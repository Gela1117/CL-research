Abstract

Character language models have access to sur-
face morphological patterns, but it is not clear
whether or how they learn abstract morpho-
logical regularities. We instrument a charac-
ter language model with several probes, ﬁnd-
ing that it can develop a speciﬁc unit to iden-
tify word boundaries and, by extension, mor-
pheme boundaries, which allows it to capture
linguistic properties and regularities of these
units. Our language model proves surpris-
ingly good at identifying the selectional re-
strictions of English derivational morphemes,
a task that requires both morphological and
syntactic awareness. Thus we conclude that,
when morphemes overlap extensively with the
words of a language, a character language
model can perform morphological abstraction.

Introduction

1
Character-level language models (Sutskever et al.,
2011) are appealing because they enable open-
vocabulary generation of language, and condi-
tional character language models have now been
convincingly used in speech recognition (Chan
et al., 2016) and machine translation (Weiss et al.,
2017; Lee et al., 2016; Chung et al., 2016). They
succeed due to parameter-sharing between fre-
quent, rare, and even unobserved training words,
prompting claims that they learn morphosyntac-
tic properties of words.
For example, Chung
et al. (2016) claim that character language mod-
els yield “better modelling [of] rare morpholog-
ical variants” while Kim et al. (2016) claim that
“Character-level models obviate the need for mor-
phological tagging or manual feature engineer-
ing.” But these claims of morphological awareness
are backed more by intuition than direct empirical
evidence. What do these models really learn about
morphology? And, to the extent that they learn
about morphology, how do they learn it?

Our goal is to shed light on these questions, and
to that end, we study the behavior of a character-
level language model (hereafter LM) applied to
English. We observe that, when generating text,
the LM applies certain morphological processes
of English productively, i.e.
in novel contexts
(§3). This rather surprising ﬁnding suggests that
the model can identify the morphemes relevant to
these processes. An analysis of the LM’s hidden
units presents a possible explanation:
there ap-
pears to be one particular unit that ﬁres at mor-
pheme and word boundaries (§4). Further experi-
ments reveal that the LM learns morpheme bound-
aries through extrapolation from word boundaries
(§5). In addition to morphology, the LM appears
to encode syntactic information about words, i.e.
their part of speech (§6). With access to both
morphology and syntax, the model should also be
able to learn linguistic phenomena at the intersec-
tion of the two domains, which we indeed ﬁnd to
be the case:
the LM captures the (syntactic) se-
lectional restrictions of English derivational mor-
phemes, albeit with some incorrect generalizations
(§7). The conclusions of this work can thus be
summarized in two main points—a character-level
language model can:

1. learn to identify linguistic units of higher or-

der, such as morphemes and words.

2. learn some underlying linguistic properties

and regularities of said units.

2 Language Modeling

The LM explored in this work is a ‘wordless’ char-
acter RNN with LSTM units (Karpathy, 2015).1

1Karpathy (2015) is a blog post that discusses exactly this
model. We are unaware of scholarly publications that use
this model in isolation, though it is used in several conditional
models (Chan et al., 2016; Weiss et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2016;
Chung et al., 2016), and it is similar to the character RNN

Proceedingsofthe2018EMNLPWorkshopBlackboxNLP:AnalyzingandInterpretingNeuralNetworksforNLP,pages145–153Brussels,Belgium,November1,2018.c(cid:13)2018AssociationforComputationalLinguistics145It is ‘wordless’ in the sense that input is not seg-
mented into words, and spaces are treated just like
any other character. This architecture allows for
experiments on a subword, i.e. morphological
level: we can feed a partial word and ask the model
to complete it or record the probability the model
assigns to an ending of our choice.

2.1 Formulation
At each timestep t, character ct is projected into a
high-dimensional space by a character embedding
matrix E ∈ R|V |×d: xct = ET vct, where |V | is the
vocabulary of characters encountered in the train-
ing data, d is the dimension of the character em-
beddings and vct ∈ R|V | is a one-hot vector with
ctth element set to 1 and all other elements set to
zero.

The hidden state of the neural network is ob-
tained as: ht = LSTM(xct; ht−1). This hidden
state is followed by a linear transformation and a
softmax function over all elements of V , which re-
sults in a probability distribution.
p(ct+1 = c | ht) = softmax(Woht+bo)i ∀c ∈ V
where i is the index of c in V .

2.2 Training
The model was trained on a continuous stream
of the ﬁrst 7M character tokens from the English
Wikipedia corpus. Data was not lowercased and
it was randomly split into training (90%) and de-
velopment (10%). Following a grid search over
hyperparameters on a subset of the training data,
we chose to use one layer with a hidden unit size
of 256, a learning rate of 0.003, minibatch size of
50, and dropout rate of 0.2, applied to the input of
the hidden layer.
3 The English dialect of a character LM
In an initial analysis of the learned model we stud-
ied text generated with the LM and found that it
closely resembled English on the word level and,
to some degree, on the level of syntax.

3.1 Words
When sampled, the LM generates real English
words most of the time, and only about 1 in ev-
ery 20 tokens is a nonce word.2 Regular morpho-
of Sutskever et al. (2011), which uses a multiplicative RNN
rather than an LSTM unit.

tionaries.

logical patterns can be observed within some of
these nonce words (Table 1). The words sinding,
fatities and complessed all seem like well-formed
inﬂected variants of English-looking words. The
forms breaked and indicatement show productive
morphological patterns of inﬂection and deriva-
tion being applied to bases of the correct syntactic
class, namely verbs. It happens that break is an ir-
regular verb and indicate forms a noun with sufﬁx
-ion rather than -ment, but these are lexical rules
that block the more regular inﬂectional and deriva-
tional rules the LM has applied.
In addition to
composing morphologically complex words, the
LM also attempts to decompose them, as can be
seen with the forms therapie and applie. Here
the inﬂectional sufﬁx -s has been dropped, but
the orthographic change associated with it has not
been successfully reversed. Not all nonce words
generated by the LM can be explained in terms
of morphological productivity, however: knwota-
tor, mindt, and ouctromor don’t resemble any real
morphemes and don’t follow English phonotac-
tics. These forms may be highly improbable ac-
cidents of the sampling process.

3.2 Sentences
Consider the sentence in Table 2 generated with
the LM through sampling. The sentence could not
be considered ﬂuent or grammatical: there are no
clear dependencies between verbs, subjects, and
objects; it contains the nonce word eviven and the
novel and unlikely compound weaken-little. Yet,
some short-distance syntactic regularities can be
observed. Articles precede adjectives and nouns
but not verbs, prepositions precede nouns, and par-
ticle to precedes a verb. On an even larger scale,
the clause the novel regarded the modern Labora-

sentence appears unnatural due to its odd seman-
tics, but consider the following alternative choice
of words for the same syntactic structure: the man
thought the modern laboratory has a weaken-little

anomalous.

The predominantly well-formed output of the
LM suggests that it is appropriate to further study
the linguistic regularities learned by it.

4 Meaningful hidden units in the LM

The hidden units of the LM were analyzed by
feeding the training data back into the system and
tracking unit activations on each timestep, i.e. af-
ter every character. For each unit, the ﬁve inputs
which triggered highest activation (highest abso-
lute value) were recorded (Kadar et al., 2016).
About 40 units exhibited patterns of activation that
could be identiﬁed as meaningful with the human
eye. We selected three of the more interesting
units to brieﬂy discuss here. Table 3 shows a list
of the top ﬁve triggers for each of these units, to-
gether with up to 13 characters that preceded them,
to put them in context. One unit, which we’ll dub
the punctuation unit, seems to respond to closing
punctuation marks. Another, dubbed the Latinate
sufﬁx unit, appears to recognize contexts that are
likely to precede sufﬁx -ion and its variants, -ation,
-ction and -tion.

3That is, assuming that novel is a noun in this context and
weaken-little is an adjective, by analogy with its second base.

4.1 The word unit
The most interesting unit, the word unit, appears
to recognize complete words and sub-word units
within them. Figure 1 shows the activation pat-
tern of the word unit over a partial sentence from
the training data. The dotted lines, which mark
the end of tokens, often coincide with the peaks
in activation. The unit also recognizes the base it
within its and according within accordingly. The
behavior of the unit could be explained either as
a signal for the end of a familiar, repeated pat-
tern, or as a predictor of a following space. The
fact that we don’t see a peak in activation at the
right bracket symbol (which should be a cue for a
following space) suggests that the former explana-
tion is more plausible. Support for this idea comes
from the low correlation coefﬁcient between the
activation of the unit and the probability the model
assigns to a following space: only 0.08 across the
entire training set. It appears that the LM knows
that linguistic units need not occur on their own,
i.e. that in a lot of cases a sufﬁx is very likely to
follow.

5 Morphemes encoded by the LM
Morphological segmentation aims to identify the
boundaries in morphologically complex words,
i.e. words consisting of multiple morphemes. A
morpheme boundary could separate a base from an
inﬂectional morpheme, e.g. like+s and carrie+s,
a base from a derivational morpheme, e.g. con-
sider+able, or two bases, e.g. air+plane. One ap-
proach to morphological segmentation is to see it
as a sequence-labeling task, where words are pro-
cessed one character at a time and every between-
character position is considered a potential bound-
ary. RNNs are particularly suitable for sequence

147labeling and recent work on supervised morpho-
logical segmentation with RNNs shows promising
results (Wang et al., 2016).

In this experiment we probe the LM using a
model for morphological segmentation to test the
extent to which the LM captures morphological
regularities.

5.1 Formulation
At each timestep t, character ct is projected into
high-dimensional space:

xct = ET vi

t = LST M enc(xct; henc

The hidden state of the encoder is obtained as be-
fore: henc

state of the decoder is then obtained as: hdec
t =
LST M dec(henc
t−1) and followed by a linear
transformation and a softmax function over all el-
ements in Vlab, which results in a probability dis-
tribution over labels.

5.2 Data
The model
referred to as C2M,
character-to-morpheme) was trained on a com-
bined set of gold standard (GS) segmentations
from MorphoChallenge 2010 and Hutmegs 1.0
(free data). The data consisted of 2275 word
forms; 90% were used for training and 10% for
testing. For the purposes of meaningful LM em-
beddings, which are highly contextual, a past con-
text is necessary. Since GS segmentations are
available for words in isolation only, we extract
contexts for every word from the Wiki data, tak-
ing the 15 word tokens that preceded the word on
up to 15 of its appearances in the dump. The oc-
currence of a word in each of its contexts was then
treated as a separate training instance.

5.3 Performance
The system achieved a rather low F1 score: 53.3.
Compared to Ruokolainen et al. (2013), who ob-
tain F1 score 86.5 with a bidirectional CRF model,
C2M is clearly inferior. This is not particularly

surprising given that the CRF makes predictions
conditioned on past and future context, while C2M
only has access to the past context. Recall also that
the encoder of C2M shares the weights of the LM
and is not ﬁne-tuned for morphological segmenta-
tion. But taken as a probe of the LM’s encoding,
the F1 score of 53.3 suggests that this encoding
still contains some information about morpheme
boundaries. A breakdown of morphemic bound-
aries by type provides insights into the source of
performance and limitations of C2M.

Potential word endings as cues for morpheme
boundaries The results labeled C2M - WE and
C2M - ¬WE in Table 4 refer to two types of mor-
pheme boundaries: boundaries that could also be
a word ending (WE), e.g. drink+ing, agree+ment,
and boundaries that could not be a word ending
(¬ WE), e.g. dis+like, intens+ify. It becomes ap-
parent that a large portion of the correct segmen-
tations produced by C2M can be attributed to an
ability to recognize word endings. Earlier ﬁndings
relating to the word unit of the LM (section 4.1)
align with this line of argument: the unit indeed
detects words, and those morphemes that resem-
ble words. The sample segmentations in A and C
of Table 5 can be straightforwardly explained in
terms of transfer knowledge on word endings: act,
action and ant are all words the LM has encoun-
tered during training. Notice that the morpheme
ant has not been observed by C2M, i.e. it is not in
the training data, but its status as a word is encoded
by the LM.

Actual word endings An interesting result
emerges when C2M’s performance is tested on
word-ﬁnal characters, which by default should
all be labeled as a morpheme boundary (C2M -
EOW in Table 4). Recall that the rest of the
results exclude these predictions, since morpho-
logical segmentation concerns word-internal mor-
pheme boundaries. C2M performs extremely well
at identifying actual word endings. The margin be-
tween C2M - WE results and C2M - EOW results is

substantial, even though both look at units of the
same type, namely words. The higher accuracy
in the EOW setting shows that the LM prefers to
ends word where they actually end, rather than at
earlier points that would have also allowed it. The
LM thus appears to take into consideration context
and what words would syntactically ﬁt in it. Con-
sider example E in Table 5. This instance of the
word in+tense+ly occurred in the context of the
Himalayan regions of. In this context C2M fails
to predict a morpheme boundary, even though in
is a very frequent word on its own. The LM may
be aware that preposition in would not ﬁt syntacti-
cally in the context, i.e. that the sequence regions
of in is ungrammatical. It thus waits to see a longer
sequence that would better ﬁt the context, such as
intense or intensely. Example D shows that C2M
is indeed capable of segmenting preﬁx in in other
contexts. The word included is preceded by the
context the English term propaganda. This con-
the English
text allows a following preposition:
term propaganda in, so the LM predicted that the
word may end after just in, which allowed C2M to
correctly predict a boundary after the preﬁx.

6 Parts of speech encoded by the LM

Part-of-speech (POS) tagging is also seen as a se-
quence labeling task because words can take on
different parts of speech in different contexts. Ac-
cess to the subword level can be highly beneﬁcial
to POS tagging, since the shape of words often re-
veals their syntax: words ending in -ed, for exam-
ple, are much more often verbs or adjectives than
nouns. Recent studies in the area of POS tagging
demonstrate that processing input on a subword-
level indeed boosts the performance of such sys-
tems (dos Santos and Zadrozny, 2014). Here we
probe the LM with a POS-tagging model, here-
after C2T (character-to-tag).
Its formulation is
identical to that of C2M.

6.1 Data
We used the English UD corpus (with UD POS
tags) with an 80-10-10 train-dev-test split. Train-
ing data for character-level prediction was created
by pairing each character of a word with the POS
tag of that word, e.g. ’likeVERB’ was labeled as as
(cid:104)VERB VERB VERB VERB(cid:105). UD doesn’t specify
a POS tag for the space character, so we used the
generic X tag for it. Similarly to C2M, encodings
for C2T were obtained for words in context.

6.2 Performance
C2T obtained an accuracy score of 78.85% on
the character level and 87.06% on the word level,
where word-level accuracy was measured by com-
paring the tag predicted for the last character of a
word to the gold standard tag. The per-character
score is naturally lower by a large margin, as pre-
dictions early on in the word are based on very lit-
tle information about the identity of the word. No-
tice that the per-word score for C2T falls short of
the state-of-the-art in POS tagging due a structural
limitation:
the tagger assigns tags based on just
past and present information. The high accuracy
of C2T in spite of this limitation suggests that the
majority of the information concerning the POS
tag of a word is contained within that word and its
past context, and that the LM is particularly good
at encoding this information.
Evolution of Tag Predictions over Time Fig-
ure 6.2 illustrates the evolution of POS tag pre-
dictions over the string and I have already over-
heard youngsters (extract from the UD data) as
processed by C2T. Early into the word already, for
example, C2T identiﬁes the word, recognizes it as
an adverb and maintains this hypothesis through-
out. With respect to the morphologically complex
word youngsters we see C2T making reasonable
predictions, predicting PRON for you-, ADJ for
the next two characters and NOUN for youngster-
and youngsters.

7 Selectional restrictions in the LM
English derivational sufﬁxes have selectional re-
strictions with respect to the syntactic category of
the base they would attach to. Sufﬁxes -al, -ment
and -ance, for example, only attach to verbs, e.g.
betrayal, annoyance, containment, while -hood,
-ous, and -ic only attach to nouns, as in nation-
hood, spacious and metallic.4 The former are thus
known as deverbal, and the latter as denominal.
Certain sufﬁxes are members of more than one
class, e.g. -ful attaches to both verbs and nouns, as
in forgetful and peaceful, respectively. Since our
LM appears to encode information about (some)
morphological units and part of speech, it is natu-
ral to wonder whether it also encodes information
about selectional restrictions of derivational suf-
ﬁxes. If it does, then the probability of a deverbal
sufﬁx should be signiﬁcantly higher after a verbal
base than after other bases, likewise with denom-
inal sufﬁxes and nominal bases. Our next experi-
ment tests whether this is so.

7.1 Method
Our experiment measures and compares the proba-
bility of sufﬁxes with different selectional restric-
tions across subsets of nominal, verbal, and ad-
jectival bases, as processed by the LM. We use
carefully chosen nonce words as bases in order
to abstract away from previously seen base-sufﬁx
combinations, which the model may have simply
memorized.
Probability We compute the probability of a
sufﬁx given a base as the joint probability of its
characters. For example, the probability of sufﬁx

4All examples are from Fabb (1988).

-ion attaching to base edit is:
p(ion | edit) = p(i | edit)×p(o | editi)×p(n | editio)

Since the LM is a wordless language model,
p(·|base) is approximated from p(·|c) where c is
the entire past. The probability of a sufﬁx in the
context of a particular syntactic category was com-
puted as the average probability over all bases be-
longing to that category.

Nonce Bases Nonce bases were obtained by
sampling complete words from the LM—that is,
sequences delimited by a space or punctuation
on both sides. We discarded all words that ap-
peared in an English dictionary, and imposed sev-
eral restrictions on the remaining candidates: their
probability had to be at most one standard devi-
ation below the mean for real words (to ensure
they weren’t highly unlikely accidents of the sam-
pling procedure), and the probability of a follow-
ing space character had to be at most one stan-
dard deviation below the mean for real words (to
avoid prematurely ﬁnished words, such as measu
and experimen).
In addition, nonce words had
to be composed entirely of lowercase characters
and couldn’t end in a sufﬁx (as certain sufﬁxes
included in the experiment only attach to base
stems). The candidates that met these conditions
were labeled for POS using C2T. The ﬁnal nonce
bases used were the ones whose POS tag con-
ﬁdence was at most one standard deviation be-
low the mean conﬁdence with which tags of real
words were assigned. Some examples of nonce
words from the ﬁnal selection are shown in Table
6. An embedding was recorded for every nonce
word that met these conditions by taking the hid-

Sufﬁxes The sufﬁxes included in this experi-
ment (listed in Table 7) were taken from Fabb
(1988), one of the most extensive studies of the
selectional restrictions of English derivational suf-
ﬁxes. Fabb discussed 43 sufﬁxes, many of which
attach to a base of two out of three available syn-
tactic categories, e.g. -ize attaches to both nouns,
as in symbolize, and adjectives, as in specialize.
The analysis of such syntactically ambiguous suf-
ﬁxes is complex since the frequency with which
they attach to each base type should be taken into
consideration, but such statistics are not readily
available and require morphological parsing. For
the purposes of the present study ambiguous suf-
ﬁxes were thus excluded and only the remaining
nineteen sufﬁxes were used.

7.2 Results

Figure 3 shows the results from the experiment.
Eleven out of nineteen sufﬁxes exhibit the ex-
pected behavior: sufﬁxes -ment, -ive, -able, -ably,
-an, -ic, -ary, -hood, -less, ness and -ity are more
probable in the context of their corresponding syn-
tactic base than in other contexts. Sufﬁx -ment, for
instance, is more than twice as probable in the con-
text of a verbal base than in the context of a nomi-
nal or an adjectival base. The fact that almost 70%
of sufﬁxes ‘select’ their correct bases, points to a
linguistic awareness within the LM with respect to
the selectional restrictions of sufﬁxes.

Despite the overall success of the LM in this
respect, some sufﬁxes show a deﬁnitive prefer-
ence for the wrong base. A further analysis of
some of these cases shows that they don’t neces-
sarily counter the evidence for syntactic awareness
within the LM.

Verbal (green) and Adjectival (red) Bases. Sufﬁxes are
grouped according to their selectional restrictions: (a)
deverbal, (b) denominal and (c) deadjectival. Eleven
out of nineteen sufﬁxes obtained highest probability
following the syntactic category that matched their se-
lectional restrictions.

7.3 Sufﬁx -ion
Deverbal sufﬁx -ion should be most probable
following verbs, but prefers nominal bases.
-ion is a noun-forming sufﬁx:
Notice that
communicateV ERB → communicationN OU N ,
regressV ERB → regressionN OU N . It appears that
from the perspective of the LM, the syntactic
category of such morphologically complex forms
extends to their bases, e.g.
the LM perceives
the populat substring in population as nominal.
This observation can be explained precisely with
reference to the high frequency of sufﬁx -ion:
the sufﬁx itself occurred in 18,945 words in the
dataset, while the frequency of its various bases
in isolation, e.g. of populate, regress, etc., was
estimated to be only 9,7555. This shows that bases
that can take sufﬁx -ion were seen more often
with it than without it. As a consequence, the LM
is biased to expect a noun when seeing one of
these character sequences and may thus perceive
the base itself as a nominal one.

The tag prediction evolution over population
and renewable in Figure 4, show that this is indeed
the case, by comparing a base sufﬁxed with -ion to
a base sufﬁxed with -able (whose selectional re-
strictions, we know, were learned correctly). For
both words C2T starts off predicting NOUN. For

5To estimate this, we removed the sufﬁx of each word and
then searched for the remainder in isolation, followed by e
and followed by s/ es—e.g. for population we counted the
occurrences of populat, populate, populates and populated.

151Figure 4: C2T Evolution: (a) population and (b) renewable. The red square points to the syntactic category of the
base.

renew it switches to VERB, which is the correct
tag for this base, and only upon seeing the sufﬁx,
progresses to the conclusive ADJ tag for renew-
able. For population, in contrast the prediction
remains constant at NOUN, which is indeed the
category of the word, as determined by the sufﬁx.

8 Conclusion

This work presented an exploratory analysis of
a ‘wordless’ character language model, aiming
to identify the morpho-syntactic regularities cap-
tured by the model.

The ﬁrst conclusion of this work is that mor-
pheme boundaries are mainly learned by the LM
through analogy with syntactic boundaries. Find-
ings relating to the extremely frequent sufﬁx -ion
illustrate that the LM was able to learn to identify
purely morphological boundaries through general-
ization. But a prerequisite for this generalization
is that a morpho-syntactic boundary was also seen
in the relevant position during training.

The second conclusion is that having recog-
nized certain boundaries and by extension, the
units that lie between them, the model could also
learn the regularities that concern these units, e.g.
the selectional restrictions of most derivational
sufﬁxes included in the study could be captured
accurately.

Implications for future research

The above conclusions have strong implications
with respect to the use of character-level LMs for
languages other than English.

English is the perfect candidate for character-

level language modeling, due to its fairly poor in-
ﬂectional morphology. The nature of English is
such that the boundary between a base and a suf-
ﬁx is often also a potential word boundary, which
makes sufﬁxes easily segmentable. This is not
the case for many languages with richer and more
complex morphology. Without access to the units
of verbal morphology,
it is less clear how the
model would learn these types of regularities. This
shortcoming should hold not just for the LM but
for any character-level language model that pro-
cesses input as a stream of characters without seg-
mentation on the subword level.

This implication is in line with the results of
Vania and Lopez (2017) showing that for many
languages, language modeling accuracy improves
when the model is provided with explicit morpho-
logical annotations during training, with English
showing relatively small improvements. Our anal-
ysis might explain why this is so; we expect anal-
yses of other languages to yield further insight.

Finally, we should point out that it may not
be the case that a single, highly-speciﬁed word
unit should exist in every character-level LM. Qian
et al. (2016) ﬁnd that different levels of linguistic
knowledge are encoded with different model ar-
chitectures, and K´ad´ar et al. (2018) ﬁnd that even
a different initialization of an otherwise identi-
cal model can results in very different hierarchi-
cal processing of the input. We consider ourselves
lucky for coming across this particular setup that
produced a model with very interpretable behav-
ior, but we also acknowledge the importance of
evaluating the reliability of the word unit ﬁnding
in future work.
