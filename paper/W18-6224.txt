Abstract

We introduce the UTFPR system for the
Implicit Emotions Shared Task of 2018:
A compositional character-to-word recur-
rent neural network that does not exploit
heavy and/or hard-to-obtain resources. We
ﬁnd that our approach can outperform mul-
tiple baselines, and offers an elegant and
effective solution to the problem of ortho-
graphic variance in tweets.

Introduction

Emotion analysis has become one of the most
prominent tasks in Natural Language Processing
(NLP) in recent years. It can be framed as either
a regression task, where one wants to gauge the
degree of some emotion, such as how optimistic a
certain opinion is with respect to a given matter,
or a classiﬁcation task, where one wants to decide
on which type of emotion is being conveyed, such
as happiness, fear, anger, etc. The task is particu-
larly interesting for industry applications, since it
can potentially allow for institutions to automati-
cally assess the public opinion on things like ini-
tiatives, products, etc. The task can also be applied
in many interesting natural language domains. For
instance, one can try to determine whether a cer-
tain restaurant review posted in a major news out-
let favors the establishment, or whether a certain
tweet about a celebrity or institution conveys sup-
port or disdain.

The type of target domain can greatly inﬂuence
how an emotion analysis system is structured. If
the targets are formally written and well revised

articles from newspapers and magazines, then one
can expect to ﬁnd only orthographically correct
words and appropriately structured sentences in
the input. The authors of tweets, on the other hand,
often use many distinct orthographic variants of
the same word (ex: you, u, youu), tend to have
less regard for form, and use non-textual symbols
to express meaning, such as emojis. Also, articles
tend to be much longer than tweets, which have a
size limit of just a few hundred characters. Sys-
tems for the later type of domain must address a
lot of challenges that systems for the former do not
have to, which can compel them to be much more
complex.

The SeerNet system (Duppada et al., 2018), one
of the best performing systems of the SemEval
2018 shared task on affect in tweets (Mohammad
et al., 2018), is a great example of that.
In this
shared task, participants were asked to create both
regression (for emotion intensity) and classiﬁca-
tion (for emotion decision) systems for emotion
analysis in English, Arabic, and Spanish.
In or-
der to overcome the challenge of analyzing tweets,
the SeerNet system resorts to a wide range of
specialized resources, such as special tokenizers
and embedding models for tweets, emoji analyz-
ers, and even off-the-shelf systems trained on large
amounts of curated data. Though undoubtedly ef-
fective, the SeerNet has a very complex architec-
ture that would be difﬁcult to replicate, specially
for under-resourced languages.

In an effort to offer a simpler solution to emo-
tion analysis in tweets, we present the UTFPR sys-
tem submitted to Implicit Emotions Shared Task
(IEST) of 2018 (Klinger et al., 2018). Ours is
a character-to-word recurrent neural network ar-
chitecture that offers an elegant solution to ortho-
graphic variance within tweets, and does not rely

the shared task organizers. We describe our ap-
proach in what follows.

2 Task Description

The UTFPR system is a contribution to the IEST
2018 shared task, hosted at the 9th Workshop on
Computational Approaches to Subjectivity, Senti-
ment & Social Media Analysis (WASSA 2018).
In this shared task, participants were tasked with
classifying tweets with respect to the emotion they
convey.

The task organizers provided participants a
training set composed of 153, 383 instances, a trial
set with 9, 591 instances, and an unlabeled test set
with 28, 757 instances. Each instance is composed
of a tweet with a target emotion word replaced with
a [#TRIGGERWORD#] marker, and an emotion
label. There are six possible emotions in this setup:
joy, sad, disgust, anger, surprise, and fear.

The organizers also provided a wide array of
external resources that could complement the sys-
tems created, such as emotion dictionaries, lexi-
cons, datasets from previous tasks, etc.

3 Preliminary Experiment

Before conceiving the ﬁnal version of the UTFPR
system, we conducted a preliminary experiment
with baseline classiﬁcation models in order to test
some model design options, and hence guide the
creation of the UTFPR approach. More speciﬁ-
cally, we assessed two design options with respect
to input:

• Structure: Since each instance contains
an omitted target emotion word, we tested
whether it is more productive to address the
entire tweet as a bag of words, or to individ-
ually model the words to the left and right of
the target.

• Enhancement: We also tested whether or not
it is helpful to complement the training set
with data gathered in unsupervised fashion.

3.1 Experimental Setup
In this section, we delve into the details of how our
preliminary experiment was structured.
Data: We used 90% of the training data from the
shared task for training, and 10% for testing. No-
tice that we did not use the trial data for testing

because the labels had not been made available at
the time this experiment was conducted.

Models: We tested three types of machine learn-
ing models; logistic regression, decision trees, and
random forests. All these models were imple-
mented with the help of scikit-learn1.

Input Features: We tried two types of fea-
tures; TF-IDF weights from a bag-of-words model
trained over our input training data (TF-IDF), and
the average word embedding values of the words
in the tweet (Embeddings). We used the 300-
dimension word embeddings model of Paetzold
and Specia (2016), which was trained using the
CBOW model (Mikolov et al., 2013) over a cor-
pus of ˜7 billion words from assorted sources, such
as news articles, subtitles, tweets, etc.

Input Structure: We tested two types of inputs
to the models; one in which we calculate and con-
catenate two separate feature representations of the
words to the left and right of the target (Separate),
and another in which we calculate only one feature
representation of all words in the tweet aside from
the target (Joint).

Input Enhancement: We tested two variants of
each model; one trained only on our training data
(TR), and another trained on the training data
plus a set of 1, 774, 423 automatically extracted
complementary instances (TR+E). To produce the
complementary instances we ﬁrst extracted all
morphological variants and synonyms of the words
“joy”, “sad”, “disgust”, “anger”, “surprise”, and
“fear”, then looked for sentences containing these
words in the same 7 billion word corpus used to
train our embeddings. Finally, we replaced the
emotion word in each sentence with [#TRIGGER-
WORD#], and assigned the appropriate emotion
label to the instance.

3.2 Preliminary Results

The macro F-score obtained by each variant tested
is featured in Table 1. The results reveal that,
across almost all scenarios, modeling the words to
the left and right of the target (Separate) without
data enhancement (TR) yields the most promising
results.

4 The UTFPR System
The UTFPR system is a compositional character-
to-word recurrent neural network model that at-
tempts to address the challenges of working with
tweets in an elegant way. Guided by the ﬁndings
from our preliminary experiment, we structured
our as illustrated in Figure 1.

First, the words to the left and right of the tar-
get word, which we henceforth refer to as left and
right contexts, are passed through a character em-
bedding layer. The embeddings are then passed
onto a bidirectional GRU network that produce a
numerical representation for each word in the sen-
tence. The representations of the words in the left
and right contexts are then passed on to two sep-
arate bidirectional GRU networks, which in turn
produce a ﬁnal representation of each context. Fi-
nally, these representations are concatenated and
passed on to a ﬁnal perceptron layer, which pre-
dicts the most likely emotion based on softmax.

The model uses no external resources other than
the sentence itself as input, and because it is a neu-
ral model, it can be conﬁgured with respect to the
size of embeddings, type of recurrent layers used,
number of layers, activation function, etc. We de-
scribe our experiments and conﬁguration of the
UTFPR system in what follows.

5 Experimental Setup
For our experiments, we conﬁgure the UTFPR sys-
tem as follows:

• Character embedding size: 25
• RNN layer type: Gated Recurrent Units

(GRU)

• RNN layer depth: 2
• RNN layer size: 50
• Dropout proportion: 50%
• Loss function: Cross-entropy

• Framework used: PyTorch2

As mentioned in section 2, we submited the
UTFPR system to the IEST 2018 shared task. We
trained the UTFPR system over the entire train-
ing set provided by the organizers, and validated
it over the trial set. Our ﬁnal submission was
the model resulting from iteration with the lowest
cross-entropy error on the trial set.

In order to offer some points of comparison and
highlight the importance of some design decisions
made when creating UTFPR, we trained two other
variants of UTFPR:

• UTFPR-C: A version of UTFPR without the
character-to-word layers. Instead, it uses as
input word embeddings extracted from the
word embeddings model described in section
3.

• UTFPR-CD: A version of UTFPR-C trained

without dropout.

Due to the limited amount of computing re-
sources available to us, we were not able to train
any more variants of UTFPR. We also include in
our performance comparison all the baseline mod-
els described in section 3, the baselines provided
by the IEST 2018 organizers, and the 5 systems
with the highest macro F-scores in the shared task.

6 Results

Table 2 showcases the micro and macro Precision,
Recall, and F-scores of our UTFPR variants, as
well the IEST 2018 baselines and top 5 systems.
Although our approach did not manage to reach the
top of the leaderboards, the results do highlight the
impact of some design decisions made when creat-
ing the ﬁnal UTFPR system. As it can be noticed,
incorporating dropout and adding a character-to-
word encoder to our model slightly increases its
performance. While the complete UTFPR system

managed to place 23rd in the competition, either
of its two variants would place 26th.

Table 3 features the macro F-score results ob-
tained by the baseline systems described in section
3 on the IEST 2018 test set. The results are consis-
tent with the ones in Table 1, which brings some
reassurance with respect to the usefulness of our
preliminary experiment. Nonetheless, none of the
baseline systems managed to outperform the more
elaborate UTFPR systems.

7 Analysis

In addition to our performance comparison, we
also conducted complementary analyses that al-
lowed us to delve into the merits and limitations
of the UTFPR system. First we produced its con-
fusion matrix, which is illustrated in Table 4. Al-
though the mistakes made by the UTFPR system
are well spread out throughout the matrix, it can
be noticed that, despite the labels in the reference
set being present in even proportions, the UTFPR
model is slightly biased towards the anger and sur-
prise labels.

Finally, we conducted an experiment compar-
ing the robustness of the three UTFPR variants de-
scribed in section 5 (UTFPR, UTFPR-C, UTFPR-
CD). For this experiment, we ﬁrst created an or-
thographically “jammed” version of the IEST 2018
test set. For each tweet in the test set, we randomly
selected 75% of its words, and then either du-
plicated (50% chance) or removed (50% chance)
a randomly selected letter. We then trained the
UTFPR variants on the regular IEST 2018 train-
ing and trial set, and tested them over our jammed
test set.

The results in Table 5 show that adding the com-
positional character-to-word encoder to our model
greatly increases its robustness with respect to or-
thographic variance. While jamming the words
cost the UTFPR-C and UTFPR-CD variants up-
wards of 14, 3% in macro F-score, the performance
of our complete UTFPR system only dropped by

2, 2%.

8 Conclusions

In this contribution, we introduced the UTFPR
emotion analysis system for the IEST 2018 shared
task. Unlike current state-of-the-art approaches,
our model does not rely on external resources, and
employs instead a single compositional recurrent
neural network that learns representations of sen-
tences based on its words, and of words based on
its characters.

resource-heavy approaches,

Through our experiments we found that, al-
though the UTFPR system cannot compete with
more elaborate,
it
does offer a promising solution to the task that is
very robust to orthographic variance. In the future,
we aim to create more sophisticated variants of
the UTFPR approach that incorporate other cost-
effective sources of information to better inform
the model and hence increase its performance.
