Abstract

Cross-lingual representation learning is an
important step in making NLP scale to all
the world’s languages. Previous work on
bilingual lexicon induction suggests that it
is possible to learn cross-lingual represen-
tations of words based on similarities be-
tween images associated with these words.
However, that work focused (almost ex-
clusively) on the translation of nouns only.
Here, we investigate whether the meaning
of other parts-of-speech (POS), in particu-
lar adjectives and verbs, can be learned in
the same way. Our experiments across ﬁve
language pairs indicate that previous work
does not scale to the problem of learning
cross-lingual representations beyond sim-
ple nouns.

Introduction

Typically, cross-lingual word representations are
learned from word alignments, sentence align-
ments,
from aligned, comparable documents
(Levy et al., 2017), or from monolingual corpora
using seed dictionaries (Ammar et al., 2016).1
However, for many languages such resources are
not available.

Bergsma and Van Durme (2011) introduced an
alternative idea, namely to learn bilingual repre-
sentations from image data collected via web im-
age search. The idea behind their approach is to
represent words in a visual space and ﬁnd valid
translations between words based on similarities
between their visual representations. Representa-
tions of words in the visual space are built by rep-

resenting a word by a set of images that are asso-
ciated with that word, i.e., the word is a semantic
tag for the images in the set.

Kiela et al. (2015) improve performance for
the same task using a feature representation ex-
tracted from convolutional networks. However,
both works only consider nouns, leaving open the
question of whether learning cross-lingual repre-
sentations for other POS from images is possible.2
In order to evaluate whether this work scales to
verbs and adjectives, we compile wordlists con-
taining these POS in several languages. We col-
lect image sets for each image word and represent
all words in a visual space. Then, we rank trans-
lations computing similarities between image sets
and evaluate performance on this task.

Another ﬁeld of research that exploits image
data for NLP applications is the induction of
multi-modal embeddings, i.e. semantic represen-
tations that are learned from textual and visual in-
formation jointly (Kiela et al., 2014; Hill and Ko-
rhonen, 2014; Kiela and Bottou, 2014; Lazaridou
et al., 2015; Silberer et al., 2017; Kiela et al., 2016;
Vuli´c et al., 2016). The work presented in our pa-
per differs from these approaches, in that we do
not use image data to improve semantic represen-
tations, but use images as a resource to learn cross-
lingual representations. Even though lexicon in-
duction from text resources might be more promis-
ing in terms of performance, we think that lexicon
induction from visual data is worth exploring as
it might give insights in the way that language is
grounded in visual context.

1Recent work by Lample et al. (2018) introduces unsuper-
vised bilingual lexicon induction from monolingual corpora,
however, it was shown that this approach has important limi-
tations (Søgaard et al., 2018).

2Kiela et al. (2016) induce English-Italian word transla-
tions from image data for the Simlex-999 dataset which con-
tains adjectives and verbs, but they do not evaluate the per-
formance for these POS compared to nouns.

We evaluate the approaches by Bergsma and Van
Durme (2011) and Kiela et al. (2015) on an ex-
tended data set, which apart from nouns includes
both adjectives and verbs. Our results suggest that
none of the approaches involving image data are
directly applicable to learning cross-lingual repre-
sentations for adjectives and verbs.

2 Data

Wordlists We combined 3 data sets of English
words to compile the wordlists for our experi-
ments: the original wordlist used by Kiela et al.
(2015), the Simlex-999 data set of English word
pairs (Hill et al., 2014) and the MEN data set
(Bruni et al., 2014). Whereas the ﬁrst wordlist
contains only nouns, the latter two datasets con-
tain words of three POS classes (nouns, adjec-
tives and verbs). We collect all distinct words and
translate the ﬁnal wordlist into 5 languages (Ger-
man, French, Russian, Italian, Spanish) using the
Google translation API3, choosing the most fre-
quent translation with the respective POS tag. Ta-
ble 1 shows the POS distribution in the datasets.

Image Data Sets We use the Google Custom
Search API4 to represent each word in a wordlist
by a set of images. We collect the ﬁrst 50 jpeg im-
ages returned by the search engine when querying
the words specifying the target language.5 This
way, we compile image data sets for 6 languages.6
Figure 1 shows examples for images associated
with a word in two languages.

ages, some of them cannot be downloaded. On average, we
collect 42 images for each image word.

3 Approach
The assumption underlying the approach is that se-
mantically similar words in two languages are as-
sociated with similar images. Hence, in order to
ﬁnd the translation of a word, e.g. from English
to German, we compare the images representing
the English word with all the images representing
German words, and pick as translation the German
word represented by the most similar images. To
compute similarities between images, we compute
cosine similarities between their feature represen-
tations.

3.1 Convolutional Neural Network Feature

Representations

Between

Individual

Following Kiela et al. (2015), we compute convo-
lutional neural network (CNN) feature representa-
tions using a model pre-trained on the ImageNet
classiﬁcation task (Russakovsky et al., 2015). For
each image, we extract the pre-softmax layer rep-
resentation of the CNN. Instead of an AlexNet
(Krizhevsky et al., 2012) as used by Kiela et
al. (2015), we use the Keras implementation of the
VGG19 model as described in Simonyan and Zis-
serman (2014), which was shown to achieve sim-
ilar performance for word representation tasks by
Kiela et al. (2016). Using this model, we represent
each image by a 4069-dimensional feature vector.
Similarities
Images
Bergsma and Van Durme (2011) determine
similarities between image sets based on simi-
larities between all individual images. For each
image in image set 1, the maximum similarity
score for any image in image set 2 is computed.
These maximum similarity scores are then either
averaged (AVGMAX) or their maximum is taken
(MAXMAX).
Similarities Between Aggregated Representa-
tions
In addition to the above described meth-
ods, Kiela et al. (2015) generate an aggregated
representation for each image set and then com-
pute the similarity between image sets by comput-
ing the similarity between the aggregated repre-
sentations. Aggregated representations for image
sets are generated by either taking the component-
wise average (CNN-MEAN) or the component-
wise maximum (CNN-MAX) of all images in the
set.
K-Nearest Neighbor For each image in an im-
age set in language 1, we compute its nearest

neighbor across all image sets in language 2.
Then, we ﬁnd the image set in language 2 that
contains the highest number of nearest neighbors.
The image word is translated into the image word
that is associated with that image 2 set. Ties be-
tween image sets containing an equivalent num-
ber of nearest neighbors are broken by computing
the average distance between all members. We
refer to the method as KNN. Whereas the other
approaches described above provide a ranking of
translations, this method determines only the one
translation that is associated with the most similar
image set.

Clustering Image Sets As we expect the re-
trieved image sets for a word to contain images
associated with different senses of the word, we
ﬁrst cluster images into k clusters. This way, we
hope to group images representing different word
senses. Then, we apply the KNN method as de-
scribed above. We refer to this method as KNN-
C.

3.2 Evaluation Metrics
Ranking performance is evaluated by computing
the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) as M RR =

i=1

rank(ws, wt)

M is the number of words to

be translated and rank(ws, wt) is the position the
correct translation wt for source word ws is ranked
on.

In addition to MRR, we also evaluate the cross-
lingual representations by means of precision at k
(P@k).

4 Experiments and Results

English–Spanish,

We run experiments for 5 language pairs English–
German,
English–French,
English–Russian and English–Italian. We evalu-
ate the representations computed from image data
and compare the different methods for similarity
computation described in 3. For each English

translations,

word, we rank all the words in the corresponding
target languages based on similarities between
image sets and evaluate the models’ ability to
identify correct
to rank the
correct translation on a position near the top. We
compare 4 settings that differ in the set of English
words that are translated.
In the setting ALL,
all English words in the wordlist are translated.
NN, VB and ADJ refer to the settings where only
nouns, verbs and adjectives are translated.

4.1 Results
Comparison of similarity computation methods
for visual representations Table 2 displays re-
sults averaged over all language pairs.7 First, com-
paring the different methods to compute similar-
ities between image sets, AVGMAX outperforms
the other methods in almost all cases. Most impor-
tantly, we witness a very signiﬁcant drop in perfor-
mance when moving from nouns to verbs and ad-
jectives. For verbs, we rarely pick the right trans-
lation based on the image-based word representa-
tions. This behavior applies across all methods for
similarity computation. Further, we see small im-
provements if we cluster the image sets prior to
applying the KNN method, which might indicate
that the clustering helps in ﬁnding translations for
polysemous words.

4.2 Analysis
If we try to learn translations from images, inte-
grating verbs and adjectives into the dataset wors-
ens results compared to a dataset that contains
only nouns. One possible explanation is that im-
ages associated with verbs and adjectives are less
suited to represent the meaning of a concept than
images associated with nouns.

Kiela et al. (2015) suppose that lexicon in-
duction via image similarity performs worse for
7We also evaluate our visual representations on the set
of 500 nouns used by Kiela et al. (2015), which results in
P@1=0.6 and MRR=0.63 averaged over 5 language pairs for
the AVGMAX method.

datasets containing words that are more abstract.
In order to approximate the degree of abstractness
of a concept, they compute the image dispersion
d for a word w as the average cosine distance be-
tween all image pairs in the image set {ij, . . . , in}
associated with word w according to

d(w) =

In their analysis, Kiela et al. (2015) ﬁnd that
their model performs worse on datasets with
a higher average image dispersion. Kiela et
al. (2014) introduce a dispersion-based ﬁltering
approach for learning multi-modal representations
of nouns. They show that the quality of their rep-
resentations with respect to a monolingual word-
similarity prediction task improves, if they include
visual information only in cases where the disper-
sion of the visual data is low.

Computing the average image dispersion for our
data across languages shows that image sets asso-
ciated with verbs and adjectives have a higher av-
erage image dispersion than image sets associated
with nouns (nouns: d = 0.60, verbs: d = 0.68,
adjectives: d = 0.66).

Table 3 shows the image words associated with
the image sets that have the highest and lowest
dispersion values in the English image data. For
nouns and adjectives, we observe that the words
with lowest dispersion values express concrete
concepts, whereas the words with highest disper-
sion values express more abstract concepts that
can be displayed in many variants. Manually in-
specting the dataset, we ﬁnd e.g. that the images
associated with the noun animal display many dif-
ferent animals, such as birds, dogs, etc, whereas
the images for mug all show a prototypical mug.

Besides the dispersion values, we also analyze

the number of word senses per POS using Word-
Net8. We ﬁnd that the verbs in our dataset have a
higher average number of word senses (n = 9.18)
than the adjectives (n = 6.88) and the nouns (n =
5.08). That we get worst results for the words
with highest number of different word senses is in
agreement with Gerz et al. (2016), who ﬁnd that
in a monolingual word similarity prediction task,
models perform worse for verbs with more differ-
ent senses than for less polysemous verbs.

5 Conclusion

We showed that existing work on learning cross-
lingual word representations from images ob-
tained via web image search does not scale to other
POS than nouns. It is possible that training convo-
lutional networks on different resources than Ima-
geNet data will provide better features represent-
