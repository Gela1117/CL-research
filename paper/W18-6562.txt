Abstract

In this paper we study empirically the va-
lidity of measures of referential success
for referring expressions involving grad-
ual properties. More speciﬁcally, we study
the ability of several measures of referen-
tial success to predict the success of a user
in choosing the right object, given a refer-
ring expression. Experimental results in-
dicate that certain fuzzy measures of suc-
cess are able to predict human accuracy in
reference resolution. Such measures are
therefore suitable for the estimation of the
success or otherwise of a referring expres-
sion produced by a generation algorithm,
especially in case the properties in a do-
main cannot be assumed to have crisp de-
notations.

Introduction

1
Referring expression generation (REG) is one
of the subtasks of Natural Language Generation
(NLG) systems. Given a context comprised of a
set of objects and a collection of properties that
can be predicated of those objects, the REG prob-
lem is to ﬁnd referring expressions – that is, sub-
sets of those properties – that allow a user to lo-
cate a speciﬁc object and distinguish it from its
distractors (Dale and Reiter, 1995; Krahmer and
van Deemter, 2012; van Deemter, 2016).

The task deﬁnition given above corresponds to
the content determination part of REG; in standard
accounts, REG also involves a realisation step in
which the form of a referring expression needs to
be determined (Castro Ferreira, 2018).

From a general point of view, the REG problem
intends to emulate through automatic means the
process carried out by a human being whose pur-
pose is to identify a certain object in a speciﬁc

context, using natural language, so that another
receiving user is able to precisely and univocally
identify it.

One source of complexity for REG is context-
dependence and graduality. This has become in-
creasingly evident in work that has sought solu-
tions to the REG problem in naturalistic scenes,
as part of a broader research focus on the vision-
language interface (Kazemzadeh et al., 2014; Mao
et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2016). However, con-
text dependence is also a central concern for ap-
proaches to REG that assume a more structured in-
put representation where entities and their proper-
ties are available, but the extent to which a prop-
erty applies to a referent is not necessarily an all-
or-none decision (Horacek, 2005; van Deemter,
2006; Turner et al., 2008; Williams and Scheutz,
2017). Under these conditions, it is no longer
possible to assume that properties are crisp or
Boolean, or even that both sender and receiver
necessarily assume the same semantics for those
properties. For example, it may not be realistic to
assume that all objects are red to the same degree,
or that both sender and receiver have the same
model of what counts as ‘red’. Furthermore, the
utility of the term ‘red’ in identifying the refer-
ent will depend in part on context, that is, whether
there are any other red entities, and whether they
are red to the same extent.

The above issues affect how referential success
is to be deﬁned, that is, what criteria an algorithm
should use to determine whether a candidate re-
ferring expression is likely to succeed in helping
a receiver identify the intended referent. There
are three questions that arise in this connection:
1) How to model the semantics of gradual proper-
ties, 2) how to compute the degree of success of a
candidate referring expression based on those se-
mantics; and 3) whether such a measure of the de-
gree of success is valid, in the sense that it indeed

receiver in fact resolves the reference.

In this work we present the results of an empir-
ical study of these issues, using geometric objects
and basic properties such as color, size and posi-
tion, all of which can be viewed as gradual. As
we shall see, in relation to question number 1, we
take results from the theory of fuzzy sets for the
modeling of properties. In relation to question 2,
the use of eight gradual measures related to refer-
ential success, which derive from the well-known
concept of speciﬁcity of possibility distributions,
is proposed. In relation to the third, an experimen-
tal study is made to validate these measures, as
well as to gain a better understanding of the fac-
tors inﬂuencing referential success in the presence
of gradual properties. The results are encourag-
ing, in that they show that speciﬁcity measures do
predict behavioural outcomes and hence that the
framework proposed here provides a plausible ac-
count of success that can be incorporated in exist-
ing REG algorithms.

The rest of this paper is organized as fol-
lows: Section 2 introduces the problem of referen-
tial success of referring expressions with gradual
properties, and the role speciﬁcity measures can
play in this setting.
In the same section we de-
scribe the set of measures that will be employed
in the study. Section 3 describes an experiment
to evaluate whether such speciﬁcity measures are
useful in predicting the success of a referring ex-
pression. The results of the experiment are pre-
sented in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 is devoted
to some discussion and conclusions.

2 Background
A referring expression re = {p1, . . . , pn} is said
to have referential success for a certain object o
when the object is the only one satisfying all the
properties in the expression re. Formally:

[[ p ]] = {o}

(1)

(cid:92)

p∈re

where [[ p ]] is the set of objects satisfying p.

When the properties are Boolean the above ex-
pression is both Boolean and easy to compute.
Many REG algorithms are in fact couched as
search procedures, where the process of search-
ing for a combination of properties terminates as
soon as the criterion in (1) is fulﬁlled (Dale and
Reiter, 1995; Krahmer and van Deemter, 2012).

Additionally, since it is assumed that both sender
and receiver have identical interpretations of the
semantics of the relevant properties, it is accepted
that when Eq.
(1) holds, the receiver should be
able to identify the target object, at least in princi-
ple. In practice, the ease and/or speed with which
references are both produced and resolved by hu-
mans depends also on whether the choice of prop-
erties conforms to preferences, salient characteris-
tics of objects, etc (Pechmann, 1989; Tarenskeen
et al., 2015; Rubio-Fernandez, 2016).

However, in many application domains we work
with gradual properties instead of Boolean ones
(Gatt et al., 2016; van Deemter, 2006; Turner et al.,
2008). This means that the success criterion in 1)
no longer applies, unless the properties in question
are transformed into crisp ones, as is done for ex-
ample in the conversion of numerical properties to
inequalities by van Deemter (2006). This, how-
ever, is not easily applicable to properties that are
not typically modelled as numeric, but which are
still gradual. Examples include colour (to what
extent is the object red?) or location (how far to-
wards the top or the left is the object?).

2.1 Properties as fuzzy sets
In this paper, the theoretical starting point for a
treatment of referential success as gradual is a set
of insights developed within the ﬁeld of Fuzzy Set
Theory and used to determine the core properties
that measures of referential success need to satisfy
(Mar´ın et al., 2016).

In Fuzzy Set Theory, gradual properties (i.e.
properties in which objects have varying degrees
of membership) are modelled using possibility
distributions and associated with linguistic terms
through tools such as linguistic variables or, more
broadly, the results of the Computational Theory
of Perceptions (Zadeh, 1999).

Possibility distributions are fuzzy sets that rep-
resent the available information about the actual
(unique) value of a given variable. In the context
that concerns us, these types of functions can be
used to represent the available information about
what object a given expression refers to, whereby
degrees of possibility indicate that some values are
more plausible than others.

Thus, in order to analyze the referential success
of the expression, it is useful to determine how
difﬁcult it is to ﬁnd out the actual value (i.e. the
object referred to) among those that belong to the

493associated possibility distribution to a greater or
lesser degree. As a particular case, crisp sets can
be employed for such purpose, all values being
equally and completely plausible. For instance,
one may say that the value of a variable X is in
{3, 5, 6}, but we don’t know which value in the
set is the actual value of X.

2.2 The concept of speciﬁcity
For general (fuzzy) possibility distributions, the
well-known measures of speciﬁcity (Yager, 1982)
allow to determine how easy it is to determine the
real value in view of the possibility distribution
(that is, to which extent the distribution speciﬁes
the value). This can be interpreted in some con-
texts as the extent to which a possibility distribu-
tion is a singleton (i.e.
the possibility distribu-
tion clearly indicates a unique value). There are
inﬁnitely many speciﬁcity measures, that can be
classiﬁed into different families (linear, product,
etc.). They serve to assess the amount of uncer-
tainty about the value of the variable. As an exam-
ple in the crisp case, the set {3, 5, 6} is less spe-
ciﬁc than the set {3, 5}, and hence X ∈ {3, 5, 6}
is a more uncertain statement than X ∈ {3, 5}.
Several additional theoretical results have been ad-
duced based on this core insight
(Dubois and
Prade, 1987; Yager, 1990, 1992; Garmendia et al.,
2003; Mar´ın et al., 2017b).

The deﬁnition of speciﬁcity measures suggests
a clear connection with the concept of referen-
tial success that is particularly useful when fuzzy
properties are involved: A referring expression re
has referential success to the extent that 1) the
(fuzzy) set of objects satisfying re, denoted by
Ore, viewed as a possibility distribution, is ‘spe-
ciﬁc’ (in the sense explained above), and ii) Ore
contains the object intended to be referred.

Hence, the referential success of an expression
re is upper-bounded by the speciﬁcity of the as-
sociated fuzzy set and the fulﬁllment of re by
the intended object.
In recent theoretical work,
it has been shown that speciﬁcity measures can
be used to derive measures of referential suc-
cess for expressions containing gradual proper-
ties (Mar´ın et al., 2016), and conversely, that ref-
erential success measures can derive speciﬁcity
measures (Mar´ın et al., 2018).

2.3 Spseciﬁcity measures
In view of the previous discussion, as indicated
by Mar´ın et al. (2017a), given a fuzzy set asso-

ciated with a referring expression and a set of ob-
jects in a given domain of discourse, the speciﬁcity
of the fuzzy set indicates to what extent there is
some single object of which the expression is true,
that is, to what extent this expression has referen-
tial success in the set for some (unknown) object.
Since there is an inﬁnity of possible speciﬁcity
measures, an important question is which family
of measures is useful and empirically valid in the
context of REG. We shall restrict our experimental
study to the validity of a few measures that have
been shown to be the most suitable for our pur-
poses from a theoretical perspective (Mar´ın et al.,
2017b).

Let O be the universe of objects in a given con-
text. Let A ∈ [0, 1]O with |O| = m be the possi-
bility distribution associated with a given referring
expression. Let us consider that memberships of
objects in A are ranked as a1 ≥ a2 ≥ ··· ≥ am.
Taking into account the previous framework,
the speciﬁcity measures considered in this work
are shown in table 1a. All these measures sat-
isfy an important property for our purposes: when
there are two objects that comply with the refer-
ring expression to degree 1 (that is, when a2 = 1),
the measures yield 0, which is a desirable result in
terms of referential success (since it indicates that
the expression is applicable to at least two objects,
rather than just the target). Intuitively, this implies
that if a target referent with property p has a sim-
ilar distractor with p, a referring expression that
uses p will be less successful.

The value computed by these measures can be
thought of as reﬂecting the distance between a2
and a1, that is the distance, in terms of their mem-
bership in re, between the second-ranked and the
highest-ranked entity in re of the second-ranked
entity a2, from the This is due to the fact that in
all the cases, speciﬁcity is upper bounded by the
value of a1. As a consequence, in the particular
case that the fuzzy set A is not normalized (that
is, when a1 < 1), the measure can yield the same
value for different situations. For instance, m1 in
Table 1, yields the same value in case a1 = 1,
a2 = 0.5 and in case a1 = 0.5, a2 = 0.

In order to distinguish these two cases, we pro-
pose to use measures that work as indices of the
relation between the measures in Table 1, and the
value of a1. These are shown in table 1b, and
are deﬁned as follows: mi in Table 1b is obtained
from mi−1 in Table 1a as mi−1/a1, assuming by

convention that a1 = 0 implies mi = 0 for all
measures in Table 1b. All measures in Table 1b
are in [0, 1]. Note that in case a1 = 1, that is, when
there is at least one object that fully complies with
the referring expression, measures mi in Table 1b
coincide with the corresponding measures mi−1 in
Table 1a. As a ﬁnal remark, note that m1 = m4.

3 Validating the speciﬁcity measures: An

experiment

We conducted an empirical study with a view to
addressing the third question highlighted in the
introduction, that is, to assess the validity of the
speciﬁcity measures introduced in the previous
section. The study took the form of an experi-
ment in which the task was to identify a referent
in a visual domain given a referring expression.
This yielded two behavioural measures, identiﬁ-
cation time (id-time) and accuracy, both of which
have been previously used in task-based REG eval-
uations (Gatt and Belz, 2010). Our aims were
twofold: on the one hand, the experiment was in-
tended as an empirical investigation of the impact
of certain variables, notably gradability of proper-
ties, on the success of referring expressions; on the
other, the data serves as a testbed to see whether
the variance in id-time and (probability of) accu-
racy could be predicted by the measures in Table
1.

3.1 Participants
Twenty-one participants (17 male, age range 21–
54; median age 26), with different academic pro-
ﬁles (mostly staff of the University of Granada),
took part in the study. Participation was voluntary.

3.2 Materials and design
Each experimental item consisted of a visual dis-
play consisting of 5 geometric shapes (triangles,
circles and/or squares), one of which was the tar-
get referent, which was accompanied by a refer-
ring expression which mentioned one property in
addition to the head noun. There were four pos-

sible properties, for each of which 5 degrees of
membership distinct from 0 were deﬁned:

1. Colour: Using the HSB colour space, all
colours had constant hue and brightness, with
membership deﬁned in terms of saturation.

2. Size: Three different size intervals (small,
medium and large) were deﬁned. An object’s
maximum membership in a given size was
deﬁned in terms of whether the object fell to-
wards lower (resp. higher) extremes of the
interval in the case of small (resp. large), or
towards the middle of the interval in the case
of medium size.

3. Vertical location: The screen height was di-
vided into three equal-sized intervals, corre-
sponding to bottom, middle and top. Once
again, membership was highest for objects
close to the extremes of the intervals in the
case of bottom and top, and towards the mid-
dle of the interval otherwise.

4. Horizontal location: Treated as above, by di-
viding the width of the screen into three equal
intervals.

A further factor was similarity, which referred
to whether there was one distractor in the display
which was similar to the target on the identifying
property. Let m be the degree of membership of
some referent o in some identifying property p,
and let d be one of the distractors in the visual do-
main, with membership m(cid:48) in p. Then, o and d
were deﬁned as similar if |m − m(cid:48)| ≤ α for some
threshold α, and dissimilar otherwise. Thresholds
were set differently for the four properties.
The above is a 4 (property) × 2 (similarity) ×
5 (membership) within-subjects design. We cre-
ated 40 different target items with different shapes
and colour/size/vertical/horizontal combinations.
Items were rotated through a latin square so that
different participants saw different items in differ-
ent conditions.

3.3 Relationship to speciﬁcity measures
For a given experimental item involving a refer-
ring expression containing property p, it is pos-
sible to compute the speciﬁcity of the expression
based on the degree of membership of the target
referent in p. As an example, Figure 1 plots the
normalised measures in Table 1b against member-
ship degree for the two different values of simi-
larity, for the property colour (the plots are in fact
identical for all properties). Note that in the dis-
similar case, where no distractors are present that
are close to the referent, the speciﬁcity is either
maximal or linearly increasing with membership.
The opposite is true for the similar condition.

3.4 Procedure
The experiment was implemented as part of
an Android application called Refer4Learning
(Mar´ın et al., 2017a), originally designed to help
teachers in the early stages of child education to
work on basic concepts such as color, size, or po-
sition of simple geometric objects. For the pur-
poses of the present experiment, a version of the
app was created for use with adult participants to
administer experimental trials.

Figure 2: Screenshot of the experiment app. The
referring expression in this case is the circle at the
medium height.

As shown in Figure 2, trials consisted of a vi-
sual display with an instruction of the form touch
the NP, where NP described the intended referent,
which contained the identifying property (e.g. the
circle at the middle height). The instruction was
also played as an audio ﬁle.

Of the four properties used, size required spe-
cial treatment. While the degree of membership

496in a colour or location property can usually be de-
termined based on the visual conﬁguration or the
user’s knowledge (e.g. an object in a shade of pink
has less membership in red than a stereotypically
red object), for size, one typically requires refer-
ence points to determine what counts as stereotyp-
ically large, small etc, or else there is complete
reliance on a comparison to other objects in the
domain (van Deemter, 2006).

In the present case, this would result in a po-
tential confusion between membership degree (to
what extent is this object large?) and similarity
(how much larger is it than others?). Hence, a stan-
dard of comparison was provided for expressions
using size, showing three representative sizes for
the target shape. An example is shown at the bot-
tom of Figure 2, involving circles (since the target
referent and distractors happen to be circles in this
instance).

The app recorded the object a participant iden-
tiﬁed as well as the time taken to identify it. Each
participant saw the 40 trials in random order.

4 Results

The analysis proceeds in two stages. First, we in-
vestigate the impact of the ﬁxed effects of prop-
erty, similarity and membership on participant re-
sponses as reﬂected in their id-time and accuracy.
Second, we analyse the relationship between the
primary measures of speciﬁcity and indexes pre-
sented in Section 2 and the results.

4.1 Effects of membership degree, similarity

and property

Figure 3a summarises the frequency of correct
responses, according to the identifying property,
the similarity condition, and the target’s degree of
membership in the identifying property. The same
is shown for mean reaction time in Figure 3b.

These ﬁgures suggest that similarity and mem-
bership degree had an impact on both accuracy and
id-time. However, the picture varies considerably
from one property to another. For example, accu-
racy goes down with increasing membership when
the identifying property is colour and there is a
similar distractor, while id-time is faster for size
as membership increases, particularly in the dis-
similar condition.

Figure 4 shows the impact of membership and
similarity more clearly, by aggregating over all the
four levels of the property ﬁxed effect. Figure

4a shows that accuracy of identiﬁcation is lower
when there is a similar distractor to the target.
In the case of id-time (Figure 4b), participants
took longer to identify the target in the presence
of a similar distractor. While membership degree
does not appear to exert a clear impact on time
in the similar case, in the dissimilar case, there is
a downward trend in id-time as membership de-
gree increases. This suggests that, in the absence
of a similar distractor, people resolved references
faster the more clearly the target belonged to the
identifying property.

In the remainder of this part of the analysis,
we use hierarchical mixed models, conducting an
analysis separately for accuracy (modelled as a bi-
nomial variable) and time. In each case, we ﬁrst
build a separate model with each of the three fac-
tors as ﬁxed effect, and establish whether the ﬁxed
effect helps to predict the dependent by compar-
ing this model’s goodness-of-ﬁt to that of a null
model consisting of only an intercept. We then
construct a full model combining all ﬁxed effects
and their interactions and report the outcomes of
a signiﬁcance test. Models for accuracy are logit
mixed models; those for id-time are linear mixed
models. All models include by-subject and by-
item random intercepts. Models are compared us-
ing log likelihood and the Bayesian Information
Criterion (BIC; lower values indicate better ﬁt).
Membership is modelled as a continuous predic-
tor; similarity and property are centered around a
mean of zero to facilitate interpretation of main ef-
fects. Models are built using the lme4 package in
R (Bates et al., 2015); signiﬁcance testing is con-
ducted with lmerTest (Kuznetsova et al., 2014).
Table 2 shows the simple model comparisons
for both accuracy and time. These suggest that of
all the single predictors, it is similarity that has the
highest explanatory value. The likelihood of par-
ticipants identifying the correct target can to some
extent be predicted from the membership degree
of the target in the identifying property, though
this model ﬁts the data only marginally better than
the null model. The role of membership degree is
more clear in the case of id-time. There is no obvi-
ous impact of the type of property used to identify
the target referent.

Next, we combine all ﬁxed effects and their in-
teractions in a single model to predict accuracy
and time. The breakdown of the models is shown
in Table 3. In both models, the effect of similarity

turns out to be due to its interaction with mem-
bership degree. This corresponds to observations
made above in connection with Figure 4: As mem-
bership degree increases, participants were more
likely to identify the wrong target, and were slower
in responding, in case there was a similar distrac-
tor.

On the other hand, a main effect of property is
also evident. The nature of this main effect can
be interpreted with reference to Figure 3 where, as
noted above, the impact of membership degree and
similarity differs between properties. In the case
of id-time, membership interacts signiﬁcantly with
property type. This is likely due to the tendency
for participants to respond faster as membership
increases, when size or horizontal location is the
identifying property (cf. Figure 3b).

4.2 Validation of speciﬁcity measures
In order to validate the speciﬁcity measures, we
address two questions: 1) to what extent does the
speciﬁcity of a referring expression, computed us-
ing one of the measures in Table 1, predict the
accuracy and speed with which participants re-
solve references?; 2) do the speciﬁcity measures

measures as predictor. BIC: Bayesian Information
Criterion; LL: Log-likelihood. ∗∗p < .01; ∗p <

In order to check whether the speciﬁcity mea-
sures have predictive power, we conducted two
sets of mixed-models analysis, one on accuracy
and one on id-time.
In each case, constructed
models contain one of the measures as the sole
predictor. The outcomes are summarised in Table
4. All measures emerge as signiﬁcant predictors of
the likelihood with which a participant identiﬁes a
target referent accurately, and of the variance in
id-time.
Accuracy To investigate the role of different
measures in predicting accuracy, Table 5 divides
the experimental data into instances on which a
participant correctly identiﬁed the target referent
and those where they did not. For each, we con-

Table 6: Correlation coefﬁcients between time and
each referential success measure

sider the mean of each speciﬁcity measure and the
difference in means. The latter can be thought of
as a measure of ‘sensitivity’: The greater the dif-
ference between means of correct vs. incorrect tri-
als, the more a measure is able to differentiate be-
tween the two. On these grounds, we obtain an
ordering of the measures as follows: m3 < m7 <
m5 < m1 < m4 < m8 < m6 < m2.
Identiﬁcation time We further investigated the
correlation between id-time and each speciﬁcity
measure using both Pearson and Spearman corre-
lations. These are summarised in Table 6. The
correlations go in the predicted direction (i.e. they
are negative), though they are generally on the
low side. The low coefﬁcients suggest that the
relationship between time and speciﬁcity is non-
linear; in the case of Pearson’s r, a further assump-

499tion that is probably violated in our data is that of
monotonicity.

Figure 5: Relationship between m2 and id-time

As one example, Figure 5 plots id-time against
measure m2 (similar patterns obtain for all mea-
sures). What the ﬁgure suggests is a tendency for
the measure to divide cases into classes which do
not linearly correspond with time. This is in spite
of the evidence in Table 4, that specﬁcity mea-
sures are good predictors of the variance in reac-
tion time, as well as accuracy.

Ranking the measures according to the Spear-
man correlation coefﬁcient yields a different or-
dering from the one obtained for accuracy: m5 <
m7 < m1 < m4 < m3 < m2 < m6 < m8.

In summary, the results indicate that referential
success measures can reliably predict human per-
formance in resolving referring expressions. Cru-
cially, however, the relationship is strongest with
respect to accuracy, rather than id-time. This is to
be expected: our measures of referential success
are after all intended as measures of how likely it
is that a referring expression singles out a particu-
lar object.

5 Discussion and Conclusions
This paper addressed the notion of referential suc-
cess, arguing that predicting the success of a re-
ferring expression generated by a REG algorithm
needs to take into account the graduality of the
available properties and contextual factors, includ-
ing the degree of membership in a property of a
target’s distractors.

While gradable properties have been addressed
in the REG literature (van Deemter, 2006), the im-
plications of graduality for referential success re-
main under-explored and the complex interactions
between the evaluation of the properties of an en-

tity and the visual context it is in have only re-
cently begun to beneﬁt from principled accounts
(Yu et al., 2016; Williams and Scheutz, 2017).

The account of referential success given here is
based on the concept of speciﬁcity, a measure of
the identiﬁability of an entity based on the pos-
sibility distribution associated with its properties.
Hence, we do not consider any property as nec-
essarily crisp. Rather, by taking fuzzy member-
ship degrees into account, we are able to quantify
to what extent an entity is a member of the fuzzy
set representing a property, and how close to it its
distractors in their membership of that property.
We identiﬁed a number of measures of speciﬁcity
with desirable formal properties (including that
they induce a ranking on membership degrees) and
addressed the validity of this theoretical frame-
work through an experiment. The results show
that the theoretical assumptions are on the right
track: Speciﬁcity measures are able to predict a
signiﬁcant proportion of the variance in identiﬁ-
cation time during referential tasks. Furthermore,
they are able to account for the odds of selecting
the correct referent given a referring expression.
From a behavioural perspective, our experiments
also conﬁrm that reference resolution by humans
is affected by similarity and property membership.

From the perspective of REG, the work pre-
sented here serves at least two important purposes:
First, it provides a principle revision of the crite-
rion that is typically used by algorithms to deter-
mine when a referent has been successfully iden-
tiﬁed by a description. Second, measures of refer-
ential success are also useful to evaluate the output
of algorithms. This is especially the case for iden-
tiﬁcation accuracy, where we ﬁnd a strong rela-
tionship between referential success measures and
the probability that a referring expression allows a
receiver to identify the intended object.

This work also opens a number of avenues
for future work. We are interested in extending
our empirical validaiton of speciﬁcity measures to
more complex scenarios, including descriptions in
which a referent is identiﬁed by more than one
property. Second, we are studying how current
REG algorithms can be modiﬁed to use fuzzy mea-
sures of referential success as a stopping criterion,
i.e.
to determine when a referring expression is
likely to provide sufﬁcient information for a user
to resolve it successfully.
