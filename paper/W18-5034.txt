Abstract

In this work, we are interested in the
computation of logical representations of
discourse. We argue that all discourse
connectives are anaphors obeying differ-
ent sets of constraints and show how this
view allows one to account for the seman-
tically parenthetical use of attitude verbs
and verbs of report (e.g., think, say) and
for sequences of conjunctions (A CONJ1 B
CONJ2 C). We implement this proposal in
event semantics using de Groote (2006)’s
dynamic framework.

Introduction

The aim of a theory of discourse such as Rhetor-
ical Structure Theory (RST, Mann and Thomp-
son 1988) or Segmented Discourse Representa-
tion Theory (SDRT, Asher and Lascarides 2003)
is to explain the structure of text beyond the sen-
tence level, usually through a set of discourse rela-
tions (DRs; e.g., Explanation, Elaboration, Con-
trast).1 This structure is not only of theoretical
interest but has also proved valuable for several
Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Com-
putational Linguistics (CL) applications, such as
Question Answering (Narasimhan and Barzilay,
2015; Jansen et al., 2014) or Machine Translation
(Guzm´an et al., 2014; Tu et al., 2014).

The vast majority of the NLP and CL world
relies on statistical rather that symbolic methods.
Yet, logic-based systems, which are closer to the
linguistic theories, can be a viable alternative, es-
pecially for inference-related problems (Bos and
Markert, 2005; Bjerva et al., 2014; Abzianidze,

1DRs appear inter-sententially, e.g., Consequence in Mary
did not sleep well yesterday. So, she is tired, but also intra-
sententially, e.g., Explanation in Mary is tired, because she
did not sleep well.

2015). That is the direction we advocate for;
grounded in the ﬁelds of formal grammar and
formal semantics, we are interested in the com-
putation of logical representations of discourse.
Following Asher and Pogodalla (2011); Qian and
Amblard (2011), we argue that it is not necessary
to extends syntax beyond the sentence level, as a
dynamic framework such as the one presented by
de Groote (2006) and based on continuation se-
mantics, allows one to handle discourse relations
with a traditional lexicalized grammar.

In particular, this paper shows how a system of
anaphora resolution—independently required for
the interpretation of pronouns (she, it) and dis-
course adverbials (then, otherwise)—along with
an appropriate representation of propositional at-
titude verbs and verbs of report (AVs, e.g., think,
say) can be used to account for the non-alignment
between syntactic and discourse arguments (Di-
nesh et al., 2005; Hunter and Danlos, 2014) ob-
served for instance in (1).2
In these discourses,
although the AV with its subject (Jane said) is
part of the syntactical arguments of the connec-
tives, it is not considered part of the corresponding
discourse arguments and is said to be evidential.
Evidential status impacts, among other things, the
inferences that can be drawn, in particular on the
beliefs of the author (Danlos and Rambow, 2011;
Hunter, 2016; Hunter and Asher, forthcoming).

2Following the notation convention of the Penn Discourse
Treebank (PDTB, Prasad et al. 2007), the two arguments of
relevant discourse relations—named “Arg1” and “Arg2”—
are shown in italic and bold, while the connectives lexical-
izing them, if any, are underlined.

coming with his whole family.

This article is organized as follows. In Section
2, we present the anaphoric character of adverbial
connectives. In Section 3, we start by reviewing
the notion of (semantically) parenthetical report—
a category that subsumes evidential reports—and
we highlight its relation with discourse connec-
tives. Next, we sketch our main contribution,
namely that parenthetical reports can be modeled
by assuming that all connectives behave anaphori-
cally, even though different classes of connectives
obey different sets of constraints. These ideas are
implemented formally using continuation seman-
tics in Section 4. In Section 5, we discuss related
work and Section 6 concludes the article.
2 Adverbial connectives as anaphors
In English, using a discourse connective—a word
that lexicalizes a DR, such as although and for ex-
ample in (1) above—is the most direct and reliable
way to express a DR. The three main categories
of discourse connectives are COORDINATE CON-
JUNCTIONS (e.g., and, or), SUBORDINATE CON-
JUNCTIONS (e.g., because, although) and ADVER-
BIALS (e.g., for example, otherwise). Webber
et al. (2003) argue that in contrast with the ﬁrst
two types, jointly called “structural connectives”,
adverbials are interpreted anaphorically. In other
words, the arguments of adverbials cannot be de-
termined by syntax alone (nor an extension of syn-
tax using similar notions of dependency or con-
stituency) and are found in or derived from the
context in a similar fashion as the antecedents of
nominal anaphoric expressions (e.g., she).

While Webber et al. (2003); Webber (2004)
outline D-LTAG, a discourse grammar incorpo-
rating anaphoric elements for adverbial connec-
tives, nothing is said about
the resolution of
the anaphors.
In contrast, our approach consid-
ers a traditional lexicalized sentence-level gram-
mar such as Combinatorial Categorial Grammar
(CCG, Steedman and Baldridge 2011), a formal-
ism for which parsing is an active research topic
(Lewis et al., 2016; Ambati et al., 2016), and
we focus here on the semantic part of the lexi-
con, embedding explicitly the anaphoric process
in the computation of the semantics of the dis-
course. In addition, we will see in the next sec-
tion that considering that structural connectives do
sometime behave anaphorically too accounts for

(non-)parenthetical reports in a simple way.

3 Parenthetical reports

Intensionality and evidentiality

3.1
It was observed in Urmson (1952) that some verbs,
called parentheticals, can have a special meaning
when used with the ﬁrst person of the present sim-
ple. In these cases, the verb is not used primarily
to describe an event or a state, but rather to indicate
“the emotional signiﬁcance, the logical relevance
or the reliability” of a statement. As an illustration,
Urmson (1952) provides sentences in (2), in which
I suppose is used to signal a certain degree of relia-
bility (low or moderate) of the speaker’s opinion.3

(2)

I suppose that your house is very old.

a.
b. Your house, I suppose, is very old.
c. Your house is very old, I suppose.

It appears that this behaviour is not limited to
the ﬁrst person present.
Indeed, Simons (2007)
cites dialogue (3) as an example, where Henry
thinks that is described as an evidential, indicat-
ing the source of its complement (she’s left town),
which is the main point of the sentence. This
evidential use is opposed to the traditional non-
parenthetical (or intensional) use, for which the
AV carries the main point of the sentence as in (4)
(also from Simons 2007).4 Only when Henry
thinks that is interpreted as evidential can (3b) be
accepted as a valid answer to (3a). Things are sim-
ilar with monologue; in (5) (from Hunter and Dan-
los 2014), the evidential use of Jane said allows he
is out of town to be argument of an implicit Expla-
nation relation.5

(3)

a. Why isn’t Louise coming to our meet-

ings these days?

b. Henry thinks that she’s left town.
a. Why didn’t Henry invite Louise to the

(4)

party?

b. He thinks that she’s left town.

3The name “parenthetical” comes from the syntactic pos-
sibility of the sentence-medial (2b) and sentence-ﬁnal (2c)
positions. In all sentences of (2), the verb plays the same role
and is said to be semantically parenthetical.

4Although they can serve another discourse function, AVs
used parenthetically are very often evidential. As, in addition,
our proposal presented below in Section 3.3 applies equally to
all semantically parenthetical uses, we will use the two terms
interchangeably in the remaining of this article.

5A DR is implicit when it is not lexically marked by a con-
nective such as because but inferred at a sentence boundary.

297(5)

Fred didn’t come to my party. Jane said he
is out of town.

The ability to account for both uses of AVs is
of theoretical and practical interest. First, one
might expect an efﬁcient NLP system to be able to
make the difference between, for instance, cases
where a report is given as an explanation (as in
(4)) and cases where the explanation is only the
object of the report (as in (3) or (5)). Also, propo-
sitions reported by an evidential are interpreted
as, if not true, at least possibly true, information
that is valuable for reasoning systems. According
to Hunter (2016); Hunter and Asher (forthcom-
ing), parenthetical reports are related to modal (or
hedged) DRs: the Explanation in (5) is modalized
((cid:5)Explanation) and entails (at least) the possibil-
ity of both of its arguments. While they focus on
implicit DRs, they seem to extend their claim to
explicit ones, such as (6) (or (1) above). Accord-
ing to Danlos and Rambow (2011), however, the
relation in (6) is not hedged and a strong revision
of propositional attitude occurs: one infers that the
speaker agrees with Jill’s report.

(6)

John didnt come to the party.
Instead,
Jill said that he went to dinner with his
brother.
(from Hunter and Asher forth-
coming)

This last question seems hard to settle without
conducting a proper experiment on native speak-
ers and is out of the scope of the present arti-
cle, which aims at modelling through anaphor-
like properties of connectives how DRs receive
their arguments and how this process gives rise to
(non-)parenthetical interpretations of AVs. There-
fore, we will not here take stance on the matter but
instead explain how both views can be accommo-
dated within our proposal.

3.2 Two classes of explicit connectives
Hunter and Danlos (2014) argue that some con-
nectives, such as because, restrict the reports in
their scope to the intensional interpretation, while
others, such as for example or although, behave
like the implicit connective in (5). In this exam-
ple, while an implicit because is perfectly ﬁne and
lead to an evidential interpretation of the report,
the use of an explicit connective is not compatible
with the evidential interpretation (7a).6 Only an

6A “*” marks an unavailable/ungrammatical analysis

intensional interpretation could be accepted: how-
ever in this particular case (7b), it corresponds to a
very unnatural reading. For example, on the con-
trary, does not suffer from the same limitations (8):
the explicit connective is compatible with the evi-
dential interpretation (8b).

Independently, Haegeman (2004) argues that
adverbial clauses (i.e., subordinate clauses that
function as adverbs) are composed of two classes:
central adverbial clauses and peripheral ones.
Several syntactic and semantic phenomena distin-
guish between them; in particular, negation and
modal operators present in a matrix clause can also
scope over a central clause as in (9), which can ei-
ther mean that the rain makes Fred happy or that
Fred is sad for a reason other than the rain. On
the other hand, such elements cannot scope over
a peripheral one, as illustrated by (10), which un-
ambiguously expresses a contrast between Fred’s
happiness and the rain. It appears that all the sub-
ordinate conjunctions allowing parenthetical re-
ports mentioned by Hunter and Danlos (2014) in-
troduce peripheral clauses while the ones that do
not allow them all introduce central clauses. We
think that this is no coincidence and will thus call
“central” the connectives that allow parenthetical
reports and “peripheral” the ones that do not.7

(9)
(10)

Fred is not sad because it is raining.
Fred is not sad although it is raining.

The non-alignment between syntactic and dis-
course arguments resulting from the parentheti-
cal use of AVs is in no way exceptional.8 Us-
while a “#” indicates a semantically rejected one.

7Some ambiguous connectives can introduce both type of
adverbial clauses. For instance, while is central when used
temporally and peripheral when used contrastively.

8The term “non-alignment”—or sometimes “mismatch”
(Prasad et al., 2008)—is used to describe a DR Rel lexical-
ized by a connective CONN such that the (discourse) argu-
ments of the former do not directly correspond to the (syn-
tactic) arguments of the latter.

298ing the PDTB Browser9, we have calculated that
in the PDTB, 12.7% of the all explicit relations
attributed to the writer have at least one of their
arguments attributed to another agent, principally
due to the use of an evidential. This proportion is
even higher (26.9%) for implicit relations, which
most of the time (98.0%) can be accounted for via
an implicit (i.e., morphologically empty) adverbial
connectives at the beginning of a clause or sen-
tence (Prasad et al., 2008).

3.3 Evidentiality and anaphora
Consider a sentence of the form A CONN Jane
says X and label eA the propositional content of A,
eB the content of Jane says X, e(cid:48) the content of the
report X and e the content of the full sentence. We
propose that no connectives are really fully struc-
tural, but all behave anaphorically, in the sense that
their discourse arguments are not determined by
syntax alone. In consequence, these discourse ar-
guments are not necessarily the propositional con-
tents of their syntactic arguments (in this case eA
and eB respectively). However, these anaphors are
constrained by a few rules. The ﬁrst one applies to
all connectives: a discourse argument must have
been introduced by the corresponding syntactic ar-
gument (in this case, eA is the only candidate for
Arg1, but both eB and e(cid:48) are candidates for Arg2).
The second applies only to central connectives:
these cannot “decompose” a clause headed by an
AV to access the report (here, for instance, e(cid:48)) but
have to stop at the AV itself (here eB). A third rule
is introduced at the end of the section.

This explains why the two sentences in (11) are
acceptable: although, a peripheral connective, has
access to both eB and e(cid:48) which can be selected as
Arg2 depending on their semantics.10 In contrast,
because is central and so in the present conﬁgura-
tion uses necessarily eB for Arg2; in consequence,
the AV is always interpreted intentionally, which

10It has been argued that there is no mismatch between
syntax and discourse in (11b) and that the two sentences in
(11) have the same structure (Hardt, 2013). The argument
is based on the idea that if there is a contrast between A
and B and if agent X speaks truthfully, then there is a con-
trast between A and X SAYS B. One of the issues with this
view is that it fails to account for the differences between
(non-)parenthetical uses of AVs; in particular, if (11) have the
same structure, how does one infer that the speaker/writer can
reject the truth of the complement of the AV in (11a) but not
in (11b)? In addition, while the given argument might be in-
tuitively appealing for Concession and Contrast, extending it
to other DRs such as the one lexicalized by for example would
require to drastically weaken the meaning of those DRs.

predicts the acceptability of (12a) and the incoher-
ence (in most contexts) of (12b).

We propose that a third constraint applies to all
connectives: when its syntactic argument contains
a conjunction, a connective is able to decompose
it to access the matrix clause, as in (13b), but not
the embedded one. This constraint disambiguates
between the two possible bracketings of A CONJ1
B CONJ2 C structures: when the Arg1 of the rela-
tion lexicalized by CONJ2 is the content of either
A or the whole A CONJ1 B then the bracketing is
as in (13), when instead this Arg1 is the content of
B, then the bracketing is as in (14).

This idea of handling connectives as restricted
anaphors can probably be put in practice in vari-
ous ways; in the remainder of this article we have
chosen to implement it in a logical system based
on λ-calculus.

4.1 Continuation semantics as a dynamic

framework

The notion of continuation has emerged in the the-
ory of computer programming in relation to the
idea of order of evaluation (see Reynolds 1993 on
the history of continuation).
It has proved very
useful in the understanding of natural language
too (Barker and Shan, 2014) and in particular, it
forms the basis of de Groote (2006)’s framework
for dynamic semantics, i.e., a system accounting
for the context-change nature of sentences and in
particular, the possibility for a sentence to make

299reference to entities introduced previously in the
discourse (Asher, 2016). A continuized function
takes a continuation—which is a representation of
some further computation—as an additional argu-
ment. This function is then free to execute or not
its continuation and (if the continuation is itself a
function taking an argument) with what argument.
According to a similar principle, in the continua-
tion semantics of de Groote (2006), a sentence is
a function that takes as argument not only its left
context, but also its continuation, i.e., the remain-
ing portion of the discourse, whose argument is
meant to be the context updated with the informa-
tion expressed by the proposition.

Such a framework, based on Church (1940)’s
simply typed λ-calculus, is able to handle com-
plex dynamic phenomena (Lebedeva, 2012; Qian,
2014). In particular, an anaphora is modelled us-
ing a selection function, a term representing the
algorithmic process of determining (from the con-
text) the reference of the anaphoric expression.
For instance, the pronoun she uses a selection
function sel she that, provided a context c, returns
a feminine individual mentioned in c.11 One of
the advantages of de Groote (2006)’s framework
over other dynamic systems—such as Kamp and
Reyle (1993)’s DRT or Groenendijk and Stokhof
(1991)’s DPL—is that it relies entirely on usual
mathematical notions; in particular, variables be-
have standardly and variable renaming, a critical
operation to avoid clashes and loss of information
(the destructive assignment problem), is handled
by the classical operation of α-conversion.12

We add to the continuation semantics of Lebe-
deva (2012); Qian (2014) a basic type for proposi-
tional referential markers. Mathematically, those
propositional markers are similar to the event vari-
ables of event semantics (Davidson, 1967), ac-
cording to which Marie walk is translated as
∃e. walk (e, Marie), i.e., “there exists an event
that is a walking by Marie”; the main difference
is that those markers denote propositions and are
thus suitable to represent the complements of AVs.
This move allows us to reuse the anaphora sys-
tem of continuation semantics for propositional
anaphora at no cost. We consider here that any

11Describing the implementation of the selection functions
is out of the scope of this work; however, we make sure that
their arguments are informative enough for them to be math-
ematically deﬁned.

12See Hindley and Seldin (1986) for more about λ-

calculus.

sentence describes such a propositional marker,
which is provided to the semantic translation of
the sentence as an argument, and can additionally
introduce other markers in the context when, for
instance, it contains a report or a discourse con-
nective.

4.2 Sentence-level analysis

The meaning of a single sentence is computed as
usual, according to a syntactic parse and the se-
mantic entries of the lexicon; Table 1 below shows
the parts of the lexicon that are relevant to the cur-
rent discussion. For the sentence Fred came, the
result is given by a in Table 2. This term has three
arguments (as all dynamic propositions): a propo-
sitional marker e, a context c and a continuation
φ (the variable representing the subsequent sen-
tences). It states that e is about Fred coming, and
passes the context updated with this description of
e (i.e., p :: c) to its continuation.13

4.2.1 AVs
Because a verb such as think has a proposi-
tional complement, it corresponds here to a three-
place predicate, relating the proposition being
constructed (about the thinking), the thinker, and
the proposition describing what is thought. Cru-
cially, because the two propositions are repre-
sented by objects of the same logical type, they
can both be referred to anaphorically in the same
marker e(cid:48), described by the complement P (the
proposition embedded under think). The meaning
of Eva thinks he recovered is given in b2 of Ta-
ble 2: this term states that e is about Eva thinking
e(cid:48), which is about “he” (note the selection function
that has to ﬁnd a reference in the context) having
recovered.

way. Note how(cid:74)think(cid:75) in Table 1 introduces the

It is important to remark that the object of a
thought (or of any report that is not factive; Kart-
tunen 1971) is not necessarily a true proposition.
Therefore, merely stating the existence of a propo-

sitional marker, as in(cid:74)think(cid:75), does not imply that

the corresponding proposition is true. This means
that at some point, we will have to indicate when
propositions are true; this will be achieved through
a predicate true and an entailment relation over
makers: a ⊃ b (cid:44) true(a) → true(b).

13The precise implementation of contexts is irrelevant but

a representation as lists of formula can be assumed.

4.2.2 Conjunctions
As AVs, conjunctions introduce propositional
markers; in this case, one for each syntactic ar-
gument. We said earlier that all connectives be-
have, at least to some extent, anaphorically. In our
proposition, this corresponds to the fact that the
two propositional variables eA and eB transmitted
to the two syntactic arguments (A and B, respec-
tively), are not hard-wired as the discourse argu-
ments of the relation lexicalized by the connective;
instead, two types of selection functions are used:
sel C and sel P , for central and peripheral connec-
tives respectively. These functions have two ar-
guments: the ﬁrst one is the marker representing
the whole corresponding syntactic argument (eA
or eB) and the second one is a context.
If the
context has been judiciously updated, the selection
function has then all the information needed to re-
spect the constraints it is subject to and retrieve the
correct discourse argument.

All central conjunctions have a lexical entry

similar to(cid:74)because(cid:75) given in Table 1. This term

can be understood sequentially: for A and B, e
(the marker of the whole A because B proposition),
the left context c and a continuation φ:

i) eA, a marker whose truth is entailed by the

truth of e, is described by executing A;

ii) similarly, eB is described by executing B;
iii) the

relation Explanation between two
anaphorically determined propositions (one

from eA, the other from eB) is stated (this is
the description of e);

iv) the remaining φ of the discourse is executed.
This order of evaluation is expressed through in-
termediate continuations, which are written so that
the context is appropriately updated from the be-
ginning to the end: the input context of the connec-
tive is c, (p1 :: c) is given to A which gives back
c(cid:48), then (p2 :: c(cid:48)) is given to B which gives back
c(cid:48)(cid:48) and ﬁnally the connective transmits (p3 :: c(cid:48)(cid:48))
to its continuation.

The (unnatural) sentence Fred came because
Eva thinks he had recovered therefore leads to the
term c in Table 2: because of the three constraints
applying to sel C (in particular the impossibility
of accessing the content of a report), there is no
ambiguity in the discourse arguments of the ex-
planation, which are eA (about the coming) and
eB (about the thinking). This corresponds to an
intensional interpretation of the AV which can be
judged inappropriate based on world-knowledge.
The entries for peripheral conjunctions (e.g.,

(cid:74)although(cid:75) in Table 1) only differ in the use of

the sel P selection function instead of sel C. The
sentence Fred came although Eva thinks he was
sick is translated into term c(cid:48) of Table 2: while
sel P (eA, c(cid:48)(cid:48)) is necessarily resolved as eA itself
(because of the ﬁrst rule), sel P (eB, c(cid:48)(cid:48)) could po-
tentially be either eB (intensional interpretation)
or e(cid:48) (evidential one), the latter being indicated by

301world-knowledge.

4.3 Discourse analysis
4.3.1 Discourse update
To actually compute full discourses,
two ad-
ditional elements are needed (see Lebedeva
2012, who expresses discourse dynamics through
continuations and an exception raising/handling
mechanism but does not account for DRs); they
are shown in Table 1. The ﬁrst one, Di, is the ini-
tial (content-empty) discourse, which simply con-
tains some initial context ci that is passed to its
continuation.14 The second is the dupd opera-
tor, that updates a discourse D with a sentence
S, by transferring the context from the former to
the latter and introducing a new true propositional
marker.15

4.3.2 Adverbials
The adverbial connectives, an example of which

is given as(cid:74)however(cid:75) in Table 1, are very similar

to the conjunctions of the previous section. The
only difference is that as they lack one syntactic
argument, only one propositional marker (eB) is
introduced, while the other has to be determined
anaphorically from the left context c with an un-
constrained selection function. The discourse Fred
came. However, Sabine thinks he is sick is trans-
lated into term d of Table 2; it is very similar to c(cid:48),
only the selection of Arg1 is different.

4.4 Hedging DRs?
So far, we have been considering that explicit con-
nectives always introduced “plain” (unmodalized)
DRs. By simply adding as axioms that veridical
DRs such as Explanation or Concession (Asher
and Lascarides, 2003) entail the truth of their ar-
guments (R(e, eA, eB) ⇒ e ⊃ eA ∧ e ⊃ eB),
we obtain the strong revision of propositional at-
titude proposed by Danlos and Rambow (2011).
However, to get the “hedged DR” interpretation
advocated for by Hunter (2016), one can modify
the terms of the connectives along the following
lines: use a conditional statement to introduce a
modalized propositional marker for the DR if one
of the selected arguments has been introduced by
an AV (this piece of information is present in the

14The initial context ci can be chosen arbitrarily, for in-

stance as empty, or containing some world-knowledge.
the trivial continuation stop = λc. (cid:62).

15A discourse can also be evaluated to a static formula with

context), directly use the provided (unmodalized)
marker otherwise.

5 Related work

The idea of using de Groote (2006)’s contin-
uation semantics framework for computing dis-
course structure was ﬁrst discussed by Asher and
Pogodalla (2011), who were interested in integrat-
ing SDRT more tightly with syntax. They outlined
a system that does so, giving explicitly a lexical
entry for adverbial connectives that uses a selec-
tion function to recover its Arg1. Qian and Am-
blard (2011) defend a very similar proposition, but
focus on implicit DRs and use an event-based se-
mantics instead of SDRT, in which the discourse
arguments are events rather than discourse speech
acts (DSA). Their account, as ours, is expressed in
a logical language that is simpler than the one of
SDRT, which uses labels that name DSA (Asher
and Lascarides, 2003); in consequence, all the dis-
course that they and we treat are directly and en-
tirely (including the DRs) translated in ﬁrst or-
der logic, ready to be used by theorem provers
and model builders. However, considering that
discourse arguments are propositions allows us to
handle DRs which takes as arguments the com-
plements of propositional attitude verbs (which ar-
guably are propositions and not events nor DSA).
These two previous works both focused on the
general principles of introducing DRs in continu-
ation semantics and how to ensure the accessibil-
ity constraint (for the selection functions) known
as the Right Frontier Constraint (Asher and Las-
carides, 2003). This constraint is not only of lin-
guistics interest, it also naturally lowers the ambi-
guity of anaphors and thus reduces the computa-
tion required for the selection algorithms. How-
ever, the solutions proposed in these two articles
can easily be implemented in our particular propo-
sition as ensuring this constraint is orthogonal to
the issues mainly discussed here, namely the vari-
ation in anaphoric properties of discourse connec-
tives and the interpretation of AVs.

The distinction between central and peripheral
conjunctions and their interaction with AVs has
been formally modeled by Bernard and Danlos
(2016). In particular, they account for the scope
phenomena distinguishing the two classes of sub-
ordinating conjunctions discussed in Haegeman
(2004)–which we do not. However, their propo-
sition is heavily dependent on the syntactic aspect

Table 2: Some examples of terms discussed in Section 4. Term b(cid:48)
recover with sick in b2.

2 (used in c(cid:48)) is obtained by replacing

of the formalism they use, namely STAG (Shieber
and Schabes, 1990), while we are more agnostic
about this part of the grammar. Furthermore, they
model the difference between (non-)parenthetical
uses of AVs as a lexical ambiguity (the idea be-
ing that the parenthetical version of AVs are only
compatible with peripheral connectives), whereas,
in line with Simons (2007)’s analysis, we see it
as a pragmatic ambiguity concerning the argument
of discourse connectives. We achieve this through
the use of selection functions, a mechanism inde-
pendently motivated by pronominal anaphora and
adverbial connectives. This allows us to process
whole discourses with a limited set of tools while
they only account for subordinating conjunctions
(i.e., intra-sentential DRs).

Building on Hunter (2016)’s analysis, Hunter
and Asher (forthcoming) present a coercion mech-
anism to compositionally derive in SDRT the cor-
rect discourse structure of instances involving ev-
idential reports with implicit connectives. How-
ever, their solution does not account for examples
involving an evidential with an explicit DR, such
as (8b), which remain for them problematic. Note

that the present account smoothly extends to im-
plicit DRs under the assumption that they are in-
troduced by implicit adverbial connectives (simi-

lar to(cid:74)however(cid:75) in Table 1).

6 Conclusion

We have argued that all discourse connectives—
not
the adverbials only—should be treated as
anaphors, with different classes of connectives
obeying different anaphoric constraints. We have
shown that this view allows one to account for se-
mantically parenthetical reports without postulat-
ing any ad-hoc lexical ambiguity concerning the
status of AVs. Instead, the parenthetical interpre-
tation is viewed here as a product of the discourse
structure itself. The same mechanism also handles
sequences of conjunctions (A CONJ1 B CONJ2
C). We have shown how to implement this pro-
posal in de Groote (2006)’s dynamic framework.
Such a framework makes it possible to handle dis-
course semantics without the need of a syntactic
parse above the sentence level, and in a strictly
compositional way using continuations.
