Abstract

Learning representations for knowledge
base entities and concepts is becoming
increasingly important for NLP applica-
tions. However,
recent entity embed-
ding methods have relied on structured re-
sources that are expensive to create for
new domains and corpora. We present
a distantly-supervised method for jointly
learning embeddings of entities and text
from an unnanotated corpus, using only a
list of mappings between entities and sur-
face forms. We learn embeddings from
open-domain and biomedical corpora, and
compare against prior methods that rely on
human-annotated text or large knowledge
graph structure. Our embeddings cap-
ture entity similarity and relatedness better
than prior work, both in existing biomed-
ical datasets and a new Wikipedia-based
dataset that we release to the community.
Results on analogy completion and entity
sense disambiguation indicate that entities
and words capture complementary infor-
mation that can be effectively combined
for downstream use.

Introduction

1
Distributed representations of knowledge base en-
tities and concepts have become key elements of
many recent NLP systems, for applications from
document ranking (Jimeno-Yepes and Berlanga,
2015) and knowledge base completion (Toutanova
et al., 2015) to clinical diagnosis code prediction
(Choi et al., 2016a,b). These works have taken two
broad tacks for the challenge of learning to rep-
resent entities, each of which may have multiple
unique surface forms in text. Knowledge-based
approaches learn entity representations based on

the structure of a large knowledge base, often aug-
mented by annotated text resources (Yamada et al.,
2016; Cao et al., 2017). Other methods utilize ex-
plicitly annotated data, and have been more popu-
lar in the biomedical domain (Choi et al., 2016a;
Mencia et al., 2016). Both approaches, however,
are often limited by ignoring some or most of
the available textual information. Furthermore,
such rich structures and annotations are lacking
for many specialized domains, and can be pro-
hibitively expensive to obtain.

We propose a fully text-based method for
jointly learning representations of words, the sur-
face forms of entities, and the entities themselves,
from an unannotated text corpus. We use distant
supervision from a terminology, which maps en-
tities to known surface forms. We augment the
well-known log-linear skip-gram model (Mikolov
et al., 2013) with additional term- and entity-based
objectives, and evaluate our learned embeddings
in both intrinsic and extrinsic settings.

Our joint embeddings clearly outperform prior
entity embedding methods on similarity and re-
latedness evaluations. Entity and word embed-
dings capture complementary information, yield-
ing improved performance when they are com-
bined. Analogy completion results further illus-
trate these differences, demonstrating that entities
capture domain knowledge, while word embed-
dings capture morphological and lexical informa-
tion. Finally, we see that an oracle combination
of entity and text embeddings nearly matches a
state of the art unsupervised method for biomed-
ical word sense disambiguation that uses complex
knowledge-based approaches. However, our em-
beddings show a signiﬁcant drop in performance
compared to prior work in a newswire disam-
biguation dataset, indicating that knowledge graph
structure contains entity information that a purely
text-based approach does not capture.

Knowledge-based approaches to entity represen-
tation are well-studied in recent literature. Sev-
eral approaches have learned representations from
knowledge graph structure alone (Grover and
Leskovec, 2016; Yang et al., 2016; Wang et al.,
2017). Wang et al. (2014), Yamada et al. (2016),
and Cao et al. (2017) all use a joint embedding
method, learning representations of text from a
large corpus and entities from a knowledge graph;
however, they rely on the disambiguated entity an-
notations in Wikipedia to align their models. Fang
et al. (2016) investigate heuristic methods for joint
embedding without annotated entity mentions, but
still rely on graph structure for entity training.

The robust

terminologies available in the
biomedical domain have been instrumental to sev-
eral recent annotation–based approaches. De Vine
et al. (2014) use string matching heuristics to ﬁnd
possible occurrences of known biomedical con-
cepts in literature abstracts, and use the sequence
of these noisy concepts (without the document
text) as input for skip-gram training. Choi et al.
(2016c) and Choi et al. (2016a) use sequences
of structured medical observations from patients’
hospital stays for context-based learning. Finally,
Mencia et al. (2016) take documents tagged with
Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) topics, and use
their texts to learn representations of the MeSH
headers. These methods are able to draw on rich
structured and semi-structured data from medical
databases, but discard important textual informa-
tion, and empirically are limited in the scope of
the vocabularies they can embed.

3 Methods

In order to jointly learn entity and text representa-
tions from an unannotated corpus, we use distant
supervision (Mintz et al., 2009) based on known
terms, strings which can represent one or more
entities. The mapping between terms and entities
is many-to-many; for example, the same infection
can be expressed as “cold” or “acute rhinitis”, but
“cold” can also describe the temperature or refer
to chronic obstructive lung disease.

Mappings between terms and entities are de-
ﬁned by a terminology.1 We extracted terminolo-
gies from two well-known knowledge bases:

The Uniﬁed Medical Language System
(UMLS; Bodenreider, 2004); we use the mappings
between concepts and strings in the MRCONSO
table as our terminology. This yields 3.5 million
entities, represented by 7.6 million strings in total.
Wikipedia; we use page titles and redirects as
our terminology. This yields 9.7 million poten-
tial entities (pages), represented by 17.1 million
total strings. Table 1 gives further statistics about
the mapping between entities and surface forms in
each of these terminologies.

While iterating through the training corpus, we
identify any exact matches of the terms in our
terminologies.2 We allow for overlapping terms:
thus, “in New York City” will include an occur-
rence of both the terms “New York” and “New
York City.” Each matched term may refer to one
or more entities; we do not use a disambiguation
model in preprocessing, but rather assign a proba-
bility distribution over the possible entities.

3.1 Model
We extend the skip-gram model of Mikolov et al.
(2013), to jointly learn vector representations of
words, terms, and entities from shared textual con-
texts. For a given target word, term, or entity v,
let Cv = c−k . . . ck be the observed contexts in a
window of k words to the left and right of v, and
let Nv = n−k,1 . . . nk,d be the d random negative
samples for each context word. Then, the context-
based objective for training v is
logσ((cid:126)c· (cid:126)v) +

logσ(−(cid:126)n· (cid:126)v) (1)

O(v, Cv, Nv) =

1Terminology is overloaded with both biomedical and lex-
ical senses; we use it here strictly to mean a mapping between
terms and entities.

2We lowercase and strip special characters and punctua-
tion from both terms and corpus text, and then ﬁnd all exact
matches for the terms.

where σ is the logistic function.

We use a sliding context window to iterate
through our corpus. At each step, the word w
at the center of the window Cw is updated us-
ing O(w, Cw, Nw), where Nw are the randomly-
selected negative samples.

As terms are of variable token length, we treat
each term t as an atomic unit for training, and set
Ct to be the context words prior to the ﬁrst token
of the term and following the ﬁnal token. Negative
samples Nt are sampled independently of Nw.

Finally, each term t can represent a set of enti-
ties Et. Vectors for these entities are updated us-
ing the same Ct and Nt from t. Since the entities
are latent, we weight updates with uniform proba-
bility |Et|−1; attempts to learn this probability did
not produce qualitatively different results from the
uniform distribution. Thus, letting T be the set of
terms completed at w, the full objective function
to maximize is:

ˆO = O(w, Cw, Nw)+

(cid:105)

Term and entity updates are only calculated
when the ﬁnal token of one or more terms is
reached; word updates are applied at each step. To
assign more weight to near contexts, we subsam-
ple the window size at each step from [1, k].

3.2 Training corpora
We train embeddings on three corpora. For our
biomedical embeddings, we use 2.6 billion to-
kens of biomedical abstract texts from the 2016
PubMed baseline (1.5 billion noisy annotations).
For comparison to previous open-domain work,
we use English Wikipedia (5.5 million articles
from the 2018-01-20 dump); we also use the Gi-
gaword 5 newswire corpus (Parker et al., 2011),
which does not have gold entity annotations.

As our model does not include a disambigua-
tion module for handling ambiguous term men-
tions, we also calculate the expected effect of pol-
ysemous terms on each entity that we embed us-
ing a given corpus. We call this the entity’s corpus
polysemy, and denote it with CP (e). For entity e
with corresponding terms Te, CP (e) is given as

CP (e) =

f (t)
Z

polysemy(t)

(3)

(cid:88)

t∈Te

where f (t) is the corpus frequency of term t, Z is
the frequency of all terms in Te, and polysemy(t)
is the number of entities that t can refer to.

Table 2 breaks down expected polysemy im-
pact for each corpus. The vast majority of enti-
ties experience some polysemy effect in training,
but very few have an average ambiguity per men-
tion of 50% or greater. Most entities with high
corpus polysemy are due to a few highly ambigu-
ous generic strings, such as combinations and un-
known. However, some speciﬁc terms are also
high ambiguity: for example, Washington County
refers to 30 different US counties.

3.3 Hyperparameters
For all of our embeddings, we used the following
hyperparameter settings: a context window size of
2, with 5 negative samples per word; initial learn-
ing rate of 0.05 with a linear decay over 10 itera-
tions through the corpus; minimum frequency for
both words and terms of 10, and a subsampling
coefﬁcient for frequent words of 1e-5.

3.4 Baselines
terms,3 and entities
We compare the words,
learned in our model against two prior biomedical
embedding methods, using pretrained embeddings
from each. De Vine et al. (2014) use sequences
of automatically identiﬁed ambiguous entities for
skip-gram training, and Mencia et al. (2016) use
texts of documents tagged with MeSH headers to
represent the header codes. The most recent com-
parison method for Wikipedia entities is MPME
(Cao et al., 2017), which uses link anchors and
graph structure to augment textual contexts. We
also include skip-gram vectors as a ﬁnal base-
line; for Pubmed, we use pretrained embeddings
with optimized hyperparameters from Chiu et al.
(2016a), and we train our own embeddings with
word2vec for both Wikipedia and Gigaword.

4 Evaluations

Following Chiu et al. (2016b), Cao et al. (2017),
and others, we evaluate our embeddings on both
intrinsic and extrinsic tasks. To evaluate the se-
mantic organization of the space, we use the stan-
dard intrinsic evaluations of similarity and related-
ness and analogy completion. To explore the ap-
plicability of our embeddings to downstream ap-
plications, we apply them to named entity disam-
biguation. Results and analyses for each experi-
ment are discussed in the following subsections.

4.1 Similarity and relatedness
We evaluate our biomedical embeddings on the
UMNSRS datasets (Pakhomov et al., 2010), con-
sisting of pairs of UMLS concepts with judg-
ments of similarity (566 pairs) and relatedness
(587 pairs), as assigned by medical experts. For
evaluating our Wikipedia entity embeddings, we
created WikiSRS, a novel dataset of similarity and
relatedness judgments of paired Wikipedia entities
(people, places, and organizations), as assigned by
Amazon Mechanical Turk workers. We followed
the design procedure of Pakhomov et al. (2010)
and produced 688 pairs each of similarity and re-
latedness judgments; for further details on our re-
leased dataset, please see the Appendix.

For each labeled entity pair, we calculated the
cosine similarity of their embeddings, and ranked
the pairs in order of descending similarity. We re-
port Spearman’s ρ on these rankings as compared
to the ranked human judgments: Table 3 shows re-
sults for UMNSRS, and Table 4 for WikiSRS.

As the dataset includes both string and disam-
biguated entity forms for each pair, we evaluate

each type of embeddings learned in our model.
Additionally, as words and entities are embed-
ded in the same space (and thus directly compa-
rable), we experiment with two methods of com-
bining their information. Entity+Word sums the
cosine similarities calculated between the entity
embeddings and word embeddings for each pair;
the Cross setting further adds comparisons of each
entity in the pair to the string form of the other.

4.1.1 Results
Our proposed method clearly outperforms prior
work and text-based baselines on both datasets.
Further, we see that the words and entities learned
by our model include complementary information,
as combining them further increases our ranking
performance by a large margin. As the results
on UMNSRS could have been due to our model’s
ability to embed many more entities than prior
methods, we also ﬁltered the dataset to the 255
similarity pairs and 260 relatedness pairs that all
evaluated entity-level methods could represent;4
Table 3 shows similar gains on this even footing.
We follow Rastogi et al. (2015) in calculating sig-
niﬁcance, and use their statistics to estimate the
minimum required difference for signiﬁcant im-
provements on our datasets.

In UMNSRS, we found that cosine similarity of
entities consistently reﬂected human judgments of
similarity better than of relatedness; this reﬂects
previous observations by Agirre et al. (2009) and
Muneeb et al. (2015).
Interestingly, we see the
opposite behavior in WikiSRS, where relatedness
is captured better than similarity in all settings.
In fact, we see a number of errors of relatedness

in WikiSRS predictions, e.g., “Hammurabi I” and
“Syria” are marked highly similar, while the com-
posers “A.R. Rahman” and “John Phillip Sousa”
are marked dis-similar. MPME embeddings tend
towards over-relatedness as well (e.g., ranking
“Richard Feynman” and “Paris-Sorbonne Univer-
sity” much more highly than gold labels). Despite
better similarity performance, this trend of over-
relatedness also holds in biomedical embeddings:
for example, C0027358 (Narcan) and C0026549
(morphine) are consistently marked highly similar
across embedding methods, even though Narcan
blocks the effects of opioids like morphine.

4.1.2 Comparing entities and words

We observe clear differences in the rankings made
by entity vs word embeddings. As shown in Ta-
ble 5, highly related entities tend to have high co-
sine similarity, while word embeddings are more
sensitive to lexical overlap and direct cooccur-
rence. Combining both sources often gives the
most inuitive results, balancing lexical effects with
relatedness. For example, while the top three pairs
by combination in WikiSRS are likely to co-occur,
the top three in UMNSRS are pairs of drug choices
(antibiotics, ACE inhibitors, and chemotherapy
drugs, respectively), only one of which is likely
to be prescribed to any given patient at once.

These differences also play out in erroneous
predictions. Entity embeddings often ﬁx the worst
misrankings by words: for example, “Tony Blair”
and “United Kingdom” (gold rank: 28) are ranked
highly unrelated (position 633) by words, but en-
tities move this pair back up the list (position 86).
However, errors made by entity embeddings are
often also made by words: e.g., C0011175 (dehy-
dration) and C0017160 (gastroenteritis) are erro-
neously ranked as highly unrelated by both meth-
ods. Interestingly, we ﬁnd no correlation between
the corpus polysemy of entity pairs and ranking
performance, indicating that ambiguity of term
mentions is not a signiﬁcant confound for this task.

base-form). The better of word and entity per-
formance is highlighted; all entity vs word differ-
ences are signiﬁcant (McNemar’s test; p (cid:28) 0.01).

4.2 Analogy completion
We use analogy completion to further explore the
properties of our joint embeddings. Given anal-
ogy a : b :: c : d, the task is to guess d given
(a, b, c), typically by choosing the word or entity
with highest cosine similarity to b − a + c (Levy
and Goldberg, 2014). We report accuracy using
the top guess (ignoring a, b, and c as candidates,
per Linzen, 2016).

4.2.1 Biomedical analogies
To compare between word and entity representa-
tions, we use the entity-level biomedical dataset
BMASS (Newman-Grifﬁs et al., 2017), which in-
cludes both entity and string forms for each anal-
ogy.
In order to test if words and entities are
capturing complementary information, we also in-
clude an oracle evaluation, in which an analogy
is counted as correct if either words or entities
produce a correct response.5 We do not compare
against prior biomedical entity embedding meth-
ods on this dataset, due to their limited vocabulary.
Table 6 contrasts the performance of differ-
ent jointly-trained representations for ﬁve rela-
tions with the largest performance differences
from this dataset. For gene-encodes-product and
refers-to, both of which require structured do-
main knowledge, entity embeddings signiﬁcantly

of
the errors made by word embeddings in
these relations are due to lexical over-sensitivity:
in the renaming analogy spinal
for example,
epidural hematoma:epidural hemorrhage::canis
familiaris:
, words suggest latinate completions
such as latrans and caballus, while entities capture
the correct C1280551 (dog). However, on more
morphological relations such as has-free-acid-or-
base-form, words are by far the better option.

The success of the oracle combination method
for entity and word predictions clearly indicates
that not only are words and entities capturing dif-
ferent knowledge, but that it is complementary. In
the majority of the 25 relations in BMASS, oracle
results improved on words and entities alone by at
least 10% relative. In some cases, as with has-free-
acid-or-base-form, one method does most of the
heavy lifting. In several others, including the chal-
lenging (and open-ended) associated-with, entities
and words capture nearly orthogonal cases, lead-
ing to large jumps in oracle performance.

4.2.2 General-domain analogies
No entity-level encyclopedic analogy dataset is
available, so we follow Cao et al. (2017) in eval-
uating the effect of joint training on words us-
ing the Google analogy set (Mikolov et al., 2013).
As shown in Table 7, our Wikipedia embeddings
roughly match MPME embeddings (which use an-
notated entity links) on the semantic portion of the
dataset, but our ability to train on unannotated Gi-
gaword boosts our results on all relations except
city-in-state.6 Overall, we ﬁnd that jointly-trained
word embeddings split performance with word-
only skipgram training, but that word-only train-
ing tends to get consistently closer to the correct
answer. This suggests that terms and entities may
conﬂict with word-level semantic signals.

4.3 Entity disambiguation
to get a picture of the impact of our
Finally,
embedding method on downstream applications,
we investigated entity disambiguation.7 Given a
named entity occurrence in context, the task is to
assign a canonical identiﬁer to the entity being re-
ferred to: e.g., to mark that “New York” refers to

6We failed to precisely replicate the analogy numbers re-
ported by Cao et al. (2017); we attribute this primarily to the
different training corpus and slightly different preprocessing.
7This task is also referred to as entity linking and entity

sense disambiguation.

the city in the sentence, “The mayor of New York
held a press conference.” It bears noting that in un-
ambiguous cases, a terminology alone is sufﬁcient
to link the correct entity: for example, “Barack
Obama” can only refer to a single entity, regard-
less of context. However, many entity strings (e.g.,
“cold”, “New York”) are ambiguous, necessitating
the use of alternate sources of information such as
our embeddings to assign the correct entity.
4.3.1 Biomedical abstracts
We evaluate on the MSH WSD dataset (Jimeno-
Yepes et al., 2011), a benchmark for biomedical
word sense disambiguation. MSH WSD consists
of mentions of 203 ambiguous terms in biomedical
literature, with over 30,000 total instances. Each
sample is annotated with the set of UMLS entities
the term could refer to. We adopt the unsupervised
method of Sabbir et al. (2016), which combines
cosine similarity and projection magnitude of an
entity representation e to the averaged word em-
beddings of its contexts Cavg as follows:
f (e, Cavg) = cos(Cavg, e) · ||P (Cavg, e)||

(4)

||e||

The entity maximizing this score is predicted.

We compare against concept embeddings
learned by Sabbir et al. (2016).
They used
MetaMap (Aronson and Lang, 2010) with the dis-
ambiguation module enabled on a curated corpus
of 5 million Pubmed abstracts to create a UMLS
concept cooccurrence corpus for word2vec train-
ing. As shown in Table 8, our method lags behind
theirs, though it clearly beats both random (49.7%
accuracy) and majority class (52%) baselines. In
addition, we leverage our jointly-embedded enti-
ties and words by adding in the deﬁnition-based
model used by Pakhomov et al. (2016), which cal-
culates an entity’s embedding as the average of
deﬁnitions of its neighbors in the UMLS hierar-
chy (McInnes et al., 2011). We use this alternate

entity embedding in Equation 4 to calculate a sec-
ond score that we add to the direct entity embed-
ding score. This yields a large performance boost
of over 6% absolute, indicating that using enti-
ties and words together makes up much of the gap
between our distantly supervised embeddings and
the external resources used by Sabbir et al. (2016).
Using the deﬁnition-based method alone with our
jointly-embedded words, we see a signiﬁcant in-
crease over Pakhomov et al. (2016), indicating the
beneﬁts of joint training. However, the combined
entity and deﬁnition model still yields a signiﬁ-
cantly different 2% boost in accuracy over deﬁni-
tions alone. Finally, we evaluate an oracle com-
bination that reports correct if either entity or def-
inition embeddings achieve the correct result; as
shown in the last row of Table 8, this combina-
tion outperforms the entity-only method of Sab-
bir et al. (2016), and approaches their state-of-the-
art result that combines entity embeddings with a
knowledge-based approach from the structure of
the UMLS.

Speciﬁc errors shed more light on these differ-
ences. The deﬁnition-based method performs bet-
ter in many cases where the surface form is a com-
mon word, such as coffee (68% deﬁnition accu-
racy vs 28% entity accuracy) and iris (93% deﬁ-
nition accuracy vs 35% entity accuracy). Entities
outperform on some more technical cases, such as
potassium (74% entity accuracy vs 49% deﬁnition
accuracy). Combining both approaches in the joint
model recovers performance on several cases of
low entity accuracy; for example, joint accuracy
on coffee is 68%, and on lupus (53% entity accu-
racy), joint performance is 60%.

4.3.2 Newswire entities
AIDA (Hoffart et al., 2011) is a standard dataset
for entity linking in newswire, consisting of ap-
proximately 30,000 entities linked to Wikipedia
page IDs. To reduce the search space, Pershina
et al. (2015) provided a set of candidate entities
for each mention, which we use for our experi-
ments. The MPME model of Cao et al. (2017)
achieves near state-of-the-art performance accu-
racy on AIDA with this candidate set, using the
mention sense distributions and full document
context included in the model. As our embeddings
are trained without explicit entity annotations, we
instead use the same cosine similarity and pro-
jection model discussed in Section 4.3.1 for this
task. In contrast to our results on the biomedical
data, we see performance far below the baseline
on these data, as shown in Table 9.

However, we improve this performance slightly
by multiplying by the similarity between the entity
embedding and the average word embedding of
the mention itself; this gives us roughly a further
4% accuracy for both Wikipedia and Gigaword
embeddings. Using the surface form recovers sev-
eral cases where entities alone yield unlikely op-
tions, e.g. Roman-era Britain instead of the United
Kingdom for Britain. However, it also introduces
lexical errors: for example, British in several cases
refers to the United Kingdom, but the British peo-
ple are often selected instead. We note that this
extra score actually hurts performance on MSH
WSD, where the terms are curated to be highly
ambiguous, in contrast to the shorter contexts and
clearer terms used in AIDA.

Two other issues bear consideration in this eval-
uation. Prior approaches to the AIDA dataset, in-
cluding MPME, make use of the global context of
entity mentions within a document to improve pre-
dictions; by using local context only, we observe
some inconsistent predictions, such as selecting
the cricket world cup instead of the FIFA com-

petition for world cup, in a document discussing
football. Additionally, in contrast to the MSH
WSD dataset, many instances in AIDA have sev-
eral highly-related candidates that introduce some
confusion in our results. For example, Ireland
could refer to the United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Ireland, the island of Ireland, or the Republic
of Ireland. As our embedding training does not
include gold entity links, cases like this are often
errors in our predictions.

5 Analysis of joint embeddings

To get a more detailed picture of our joint em-
bedding space, we investigate nearest neighbors
for each point by cosine similarity. As entities
in the UMLS are assigned one or more of over
120 semantic types, we ﬁrst examine how inter-
mixed these types are in our biomedical embed-
dings. Figure 1 shows how often an entity’s near-
est neighbor shares at least one semantic type with
it, across the three biomedical embedding methods
we evaluated. As each set of embeddings has a
different vocabulary, we also restrict to the entities

Figure 1: Percentage of UMLS entities whose
nearest neighbor shares a semantic type, with no
vocabulary restriction (vocab size in parentheses)
and in a shared vocabulary subset.

that all three can embed (approximately 11,000).

We see that our method puts entities of the same
type together nearly 40% of the time, despite em-
bedding over 270 thousand entities. On an even
footing, our method puts types together signiﬁ-
cantly more often Mencia et al. (2016) (McNe-
mar’s; p < 0.05), and equivalently with De Vine
et al. (2014), despite using less entity-level infor-
mation in training. Within our embeddings, ma-
jor biological types such as bacteria, eukaryotes,
mammals, and viruses all have more than 60% of
neighbors with the same type, while less struc-
tured clinical types such as Clinical Attribute and
Daily or Recreational Activity are in the 10-20%
range. Corpus polysemy does not appear to have
any effect on this type matching (mean polysemy
of 1.5 for both matched and non-matched entities).

Expanding to include the words and terms in
the joint embedding space, however, we see def-
inite qualitative effects of corpus polysemy on
entity nearest neighbors. Table 10 gives near-
est word,
term, entity, and joint neighbors to
two biomedical entities: C0009443 (the common
cold; CP = 6.71) and C0242797 (home health
aides; CP = 1). For the more polysemous
C0009443, where 95% of its mentions are of the
word “cold” (polysemy=7), word-level neighbors
are mostly nonsensical, while term neighbors are
more logical, and entity neighbors reﬂect different
senses of “cold”. By contrast, the non-polysemous
C0242797, which is represented by 14 different
unambiguous strings, words, terms, and entities
are all very clearly in line with the theme of home
health aides. Notably, the common and unambigu-
ous terms for C0242797 are its nearest neighbors
out of all points, while only two of the top 10
neighbors to C0009443 are terms.

2026 Discussion
Faruqui et al. (2016) observe that similarity and
relatedness are not clearly distinguished in seman-
tic embedding evaluations, and that it is unclear
exactly how vector-space models should capture
them. We see more evidence of this, as cosine
similarity seems to be capturing a mix of the two
properties in our data. This mix is clearly infor-
mative, but it empirically favors relatedness judg-
ments, and cosine similarity is insufﬁcient to sep-
arate the two properties.

Corpus polysemy plays a qualitative role in our
embedding model, but less of a quantitative one. It
does not correlate with similarity and relatedness
judgments or entity disambiguation decisions, but
it clearly affects the organization of the embedding
space, by embedding entities with high corpus pol-
ysemy in less coherent areas than those with low
polysemy. Linzen (2016) points out that for anal-
ogy completion, local neighborhood structure can
interfere with standard methods; how this neigh-
borhood structure affects predictions in more com-
plex tasks is an open question.

Overall, we ﬁnd two main advantages to our
model over prior work. First, by only using a ter-
minology and an unannotated corpus, we are able
to learn entity embeddings from larger and more
diverse data; for example, embeddings learned
from Gigaword (which has no entity annotations)
outperform embeddings learned on Wikipedia in
most of our experiments. Second, by embedding
entities and text into a joint space, we are able to
leverage complementary information to get higher
performance in both intrinsic and extrinsic tasks;
an oracle model nearly matches a state-of-the-art
ensemble vector and knowledge-based model for
biomedical word sense disambiguation. However,
our other entity disambiguation results demon-
strate that there is additional entity-level informa-
tion that we are not yet capturing. In particular,
it is unclear whether our low performance on dis-
ambiguating newswire entities is due to a disam-
biguation model mismatch, a lack of information
in our embeddings, or a combination of both.

7 Conclusions
We present a method for jointly learning em-
beddings of entities and text from an arbitrary
unannotated corpus, using only a terminology
for distant supervision. Our learned embed-
dings better capture both biomedical and en-

cyclopedic similarity and relatedness than prior
methods, and approach state-of-the-art perfor-
mance for unsupervised biomedical word sense
disambiguation. Furthermore, entities and words
learned jointly with our model capture comple-
mentary information, and combining them im-
proves performance in all of our evaluations. We
make an implementation of our method available
at github.com/OSU-slatelab/JET, along
with the source code used for our evaluations
and our pretrained entity embeddings. Our novel
Wikipedia similarity and relatedness datasets are
available at the same source.

We followed a similar process to Pakhomov et al.
(2010) in selecting the entity pairs to be used
in our dataset. We ﬁrst ﬁltered the full list of
Wikipedia pages to the subset that we learned
embeddings for, and then used the entity types
assigned to these pages in YAGO (Mahdisoltani
et al., 2015) to restrict to only entities labeled
with WordNet types organization or person, or
with the YAGO type geoEntity. For each pairing
of these categories (Organization-Organization,
Organization-Place, Organization-Person, Place-
Place, Place-Person, and Person-Person), we man-
ually selected 30 pairs of entities for each of the
following relatedness categories: Completely Un-
related, Somewhat Unrelated, Somewhat Related,
and Highly Related. These produced the list of
720 entity pairs we used for our Mechanical Turk
surveys.

We augmented each survey of 30 questions with
4 manually-created validation pairs using common
entities (e.g., London, New York), each of which
was categorized as Highly Related or Completely
Unrelated. We included these validation questions
at random indices in our surveys. To evaluate if
participants were reading the questions, we binned
their ratings on these validation questions into 0-
25 (Completely Unrelated), 26-50 (Somewhat Un-
related), 51-75 (Somewhat Related), and 76-100
(Highly Related).
If a participant’s ratings dis-
agreed with ours on multiple validation questions,
we discarded their data (we allowed disagreement
on a single question, as some validation questions
had high variance in responses among reliable an-
notators).

We recruited 6 participants for each survey, for a
total of 34 unique participants across the 48 HITs.
Participants were presented with a message de-
scribing the survey and stating that by clicking
the button at the bottom of the message to begin
the survey, they were providing informed consent
to participate.
Identifying participant data was
not collected, and we used only the anonymous
worker IDs provided by the Mechanical Turk in-
terface to collate our data and remunerate work-
ers. Participants were asked optional demographic
questions about their age bracket and native lan-
guage at the end of the survey; we did not end up
using age information, but ﬁltered our participants
for those that self-reported English reading proﬁ-
ciency. The majority responded to a single HIT,

while 3 completed more than 20. We discarded all
submissions from 3 participants, as they did not re-
port English reading proﬁciency (1) or did not sat-
isfy the validation questions (2). All participants
were paid state minimum wage at the time of the
study for their time, regardless of whether they an-
swered demographic questions or if we used their
data in the ﬁnal sample. Collection of this data was
approved under Ohio State University IRB proto-
col 2017E0050.

To generate the ﬁnal dataset, we assessed each
participant’s responses to the validation questions
in each survey. We kept surveys for which we had
at least 4 participants with satisfactory answers to
the validation questions; this resulted in discard-
ing 1 of the 24 HITs for each task. Due to 2 re-
peated pairs, this gave us ﬁnal dataset sizes of 688
pairs for each of similarity and relatedness, 658 of
which were shared between the tasks.

Following Pakhomov et al. (2010), we assessed
inter-annotator agreement using the intraclass cor-
relation coefﬁcient (ICC). Table 11 gives the val-
ues for our datasets. The numbers reported are
within the moderate range, and they correspond to
the ICC numbers reported by Pakhomov et al. on
the UMNSRS datasets.
