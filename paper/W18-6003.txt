Abstract

Although treebanks annotated according to the
guidelines of Universal Dependencies (UD)
now exist for many languages,
the goal of
annotating the same phenomena in a cross-
linguistically consistent fashion is not always
met.
In this paper, we investigate one phe-
nomenon where we believe such consistency
is lacking, namely expletive elements. Such
elements occupy a position that is structurally
associated with a core argument (or sometimes
an oblique dependent), yet are non-referential
and semantically void. Many UD treebanks
identify at least some elements as expletive,
but the range of phenomena differs between
treebanks, even for closely related languages,
and sometimes even for different treebanks for
the same language. In this paper, we present
criteria for identifying expletives that are ap-
plicable across languages and compatible with
the goals of UD, give an overview of exple-
tives as found in current UD treebanks, and
present recommendations for the annotation of
expletives so that more consistent annotation
can be achieved in future releases.

Introduction

1
Universal Dependencies (UD) is a framework for
morphosyntactic annotation that aims to provide
useful information for downstream NLP applica-
tions in a cross-linguistically consistent fashion
(Nivre, 2015; Nivre et al., 2016). Many such ap-
plications require an analysis of referring expres-
sions. In co-reference resolution, for example, it
is important to be able to separate anaphoric uses
of pronouns such as it from non-referential uses
(Boyd et al., 2005; Evans, 2001; Uryupina et al.,
2016). Accurate translation of pronouns is another
challenging problem, sometimes relying on co-
reference resolution, and where one of the choices
is to not translate a pronoun at all. The latter sit-
uation occurs for instance when translating from a

language that has expletives into a language that
does not use expletives (Hardmeier et al., 2015;
Werlen and Popescu-Belis, 2017). The ParCor
co-reference corpus (Guillou et al., 2014) distin-
guishes between anaphoric, event referential, and
pleonastic use of the English pronoun it. Lo´aiciga
et al. (2017) train a classiﬁer to predict the dif-
ferent uses of it in English using among others
syntactic information obtained from an automatic
parse of the corpus. Being able to distinguish ref-
erential from non-referential noun phrases is po-
tentially important also for tasks like question an-
swering and information extraction.

Applications like these motivate consistent and
explicit annotation of expletive elements in tree-
banks and the UD annotation scheme introduces a
dedicated dependency relation (expl) to account
for these. However, the current UD guidelines are
not speciﬁc enough to allow expletive elements to
be identiﬁed systematically in different languages,
and the use of the expl relation varies consid-
erably both across languages and between differ-
ent treebanks for the same language. For instance,
the manually annotated English treebank uses the
expl relation for a wide range of constructions,
including clausal extraposition, weather verbs, ex-
istential there, and some idiomatic expressions.
By contrast, Dutch, a language in which all these
phenomena occur as well, uses expl only for ex-
traposed clausal arguments. In this paper, we pro-
vide a more precise characterization of the notion
of expletives for the purpose of UD treebank anno-
tation, survey the annotation of expletives in exist-
ing UD treebanks, and make recommendations to
improve consistency in future releases.

2 What is an Expletive?

The UD initiative aims to provide a syntactic
annotation scheme that can be applied cross-

ProceedingsoftheSecondWorkshoponUniversalDependencies(UDW2018),pages18–26Brussels,Belgium,November1,2018.c(cid:13)2018AssociationforComputationalLinguistics18linguistically, and that can be used to drive se-
mantic interpretation. At the clause level, it dis-
tinguishes between core arguments and oblique
dependents of the verb, with core arguments be-
ing limited to subjects (nominal and clausal), ob-
jects (direct and indirect), and clausal comple-
ments (open and closed). Expletives are of inter-
est here, as a consistent distinction between exple-
tives and regular core arguments is important for
semantic interpretation but non-trivial to achieve
across languages and constructions.

The UD documentation currently states that
expl is to be used for expletive or pleonastic
nominals, that appear in an argument position of a
predicate but which do not themselves satisfy any
of the semantic roles of the predicate. As exam-
ples, it mentions English it and there as used in
clausal extrapostion and existential constructions,
cases of true clitic doubling in Greek and Bul-
garian, and inherent reﬂexives. Silveira (2016)
characterizes expl as a wildcard for any element
that has the morphosyntactic properties associ-
ated with a particular grammatical function but
does not receive a semantic role.

It is problematic that the UD deﬁnition relies
on the concept of argument, since UD otherwise
abandons the argument/adjunct distinction in favor
of the core/oblique distinction. Silveira’s account
avoids this problem by instead referring to gram-
matical functions, thus also catering for cases like:

(1)

He will see to it that you have a reservation.

However, both deﬁnitions appear to be too wide,
in that they do not impose any restrictions on the
form of the expletive, or require it to be non-
referential. It could therefore be argued that the
subject of a raising verb, like Sue in Sue appears
to be nice, satisﬁes the conditions of the deﬁnition,
since it is a nominal in subject position that does
not satisfy a semantic role of the predicate appear.
It seems useful, then, to look for a better deﬁ-
nition of expletive. Much of the literature in the-
oretical linguistics is either restricted to speciﬁc
languages or language families (Platzack, 1987;
Bennis, 2010; Cardinaletti, 1997) or to speciﬁc
constructions (Vikner, 1995; Hazout, 2004). A
theory-neutral and general deﬁnition can be found
in Postal and Pullum (1988):

[T]hey are (i) morphologically identical to
pro-forms (in English, two relevant forms
are it, identical to the third person neuter

pronoun, and there, identical to the non-
proximate locative pro-adverb), (ii) nonref-
erential (neither anaphoric/cataphoric nor
exophoric), and (iii) devoid of any but a vac-
uous semantic role. As a tentative deﬁnition
of expletives, we can characterize them as
pro-forms (typically third person pronouns
or locative pro-adverbs) that occur in core
argument positions but are non-referential
(and therefore not assigned a semantic role).

Like the UD deﬁnition, Postal and Pullum (1988)
emphasize the vacuous semantics of expletives,
but understand this not just as the lack of semantic
role (iii) but also more generally as the absence of
reference (ii). Arguably, (ii) entails (iii) and could
seem to make it superﬂuous, but we will see that it
can often be easier to test for (iii). The common,
pre-theoretic understanding of expletives does not
include idiom parts such as the bucket in kick the
bucket, so it is necessary to restrict the concept
further. Postal and Pullum (1988) do this by (i),
which restricts expletives to be pro-forms. This is
a relatively weak constraint on the form of exple-
tives. We will see later that it may be desirable
to strengthen this criterion and require expletives
to be pro-forms that are selected by the predicate
with which it occurs. Such purely formal selec-
tion is needed in many cases, since expletives are
not interchangeable across constructions – for ex-
ample, there rains is not an acceptable sentence
of English. Criteria (ii) and (iii) from the deﬁni-
tion of Postal and Pullum (1988) may be hard to
apply directly in a UD setting, as UD is a syntac-
tic, not a semantic, annotation framework. On the
other hand, many decisions in UD are driven by
the need to provide annotations that can serve as
input for semantic analysis, and distinguishing be-
tween elements that do and do not refer and ﬁll a
thematic role therefore seems desirable.

In addition to the deﬁnition, Postal and Pul-
lum (1988) provide tests for expletives. Some of
these (tough-movement and nominalization) are
not easy to apply cross-linguistically, but two of
them are, namely absence of coordination and in-
ability to license an emphatic reﬂexive.

(2)

(3)

*It and John rained and carried an umbrella
respectively.
*It itself rained.

The inability to license an emphatic reﬂexive is
probably due to the lack of referentiality. It is less

19immediately obvious what the absence of coordi-
nation diagnoses. One likely interpretation is that
sentences like (2) are ungrammatical because the
verb selects for a particular syntactic string as its
subject. If that is so, form-selection can be consid-
ered a deﬁning feature of expletives.

Finally, following Postal and Pullum (1988), we
can draw a distinction between expletives that oc-
cur in chains and those that do not, where we un-
derstand a chain as a relation between an expletive
and some other element of the sentence which has
the thematic role that would normally be associ-
ated with the position of the expletive, for exam-
ple, the subordinate clause in (4).

(4)

It surprised me that she came.

It is not always possible to realize the other ele-
ment in the chain in the position of the expletive.
For example, the subordinate clause cannot be di-
rectly embedded under the preposition in (1).

Whether the expletive participates in a chain or
not is relevant for the UD annotation insofar as it
is often desirable – for the purposes of semantic
interpretation – to give the semantically active el-
ement of the chain the “real” dependency label.
For example, it is tempting to take the comple-
ment clause in (4) as the subject (csubj in UD) to
stay closer to the semantics, although one is hard
pressed to come up with independent syntactic ev-
idence that an element in this position can actu-
ally be a subject. This is in line with many de-
scriptive grammar traditions, where the expletive
would be called the formal subject and the subor-
dinate clause the logical subject.

We now review constructions that are regularly
analyzed as involving an expletive in the theoret-
ical literature and discuss these in the light of the
deﬁnition and tests we have established.

2.1 Extraposition of Clausal Arguments
In many languages, verbs selecting a clausal sub-
ject or object often allow or require an expletive
and place the clausal argument in extraposed po-
sition. In some cases, extraposition of the clausal
argument is obligatory, as in (5) for English. Note
that the clausal argument can be either a subject
or an object, and thus the expletive in some cases
appears in object position, as in (6). Also note that
in so-called raising contexts, the expletive may ac-
tually be realized in the structural subject position
of a verb governing the verb that selects the clausal
argument (7).

het
it

dat
that

jullie
you

betreurt
regrets

Hij
He
‘He regrets that you lose’
It is going to be hard to sell the Dodge (en)

verliezen
lose

(nl)

It is fairly straightforward to argue that this con-
struction involves an expletive. Theoretically, it
could be cataphoric to the following clause and so
be referential, but in that case we would expect it
to be able to license an emphatic reﬂexive. How-
ever, this is not what we ﬁnd, as shown in (8-a),
which contrasts with (8-b) where the raised sub-
ject is a referential pronoun.

(8)

a.
b.

*It seems itself that she came
It seems itself to be a primary meta-
physical principle

But if it does not refer cataphorically to the ex-
traposed clause, its form must also be due to the
construction in which it appears. This construc-
tion therefore fulﬁlls the criteria of an expletive
even on the strictest understanding.

2.2 Existential Sentences
Existential (or presentational) sentences are sen-
tences that involve an intransitive verb and a noun
phrase that is interpreted as the logical subject of
the verb but does not occur in the canonical sub-
ject position, which is instead ﬁlled by an exple-
tive. There is considerable variation between lan-
guages as to which verbs participate in this con-
struction. For instance, while English is quite re-
strictive and uses this construction mainly with the
copula be, other languages allow a wider range of
verbs including verbs of position and movement,
as illustrated in (9)–(11). There is also variation
with respect to criteria for classifying the nominal
constituent as a subject or object, with diagnostics
such as agreement, case, and structural position
often giving conﬂicting results. Some languages,
like the Scandinavian languages, restrict the nom-
inal element to indeﬁnite nominals, whereas Ger-
man for instance also allows for deﬁnite nominals
in this construction.

Despite the cross-linguistic variation, existential
constructions like these are uncontroversial cases
of expletive usage. The form of the pronoun(s) is
ﬁxed, it cannot refer to the other element of the
chain for formal reasons, and no emphatic reﬂex-
ive is possible.

Impersonal Constructions

2.3
By impersonal constructions we understand con-
structions where the verb takes a ﬁxed, pronomi-
nal, argument in subject position that is not inter-
preted in semantics. Some of these involve zero-
valent verbs, such as weather verbs, which are tra-
ditionally assumed to take an expletive subject in
Germanic languages, as in Norwegian regne ‘rain’
(12). Others involve verb that also take a semantic
argument, such as the French falloir in (13).

rains

it
‘It is raining’

it
three
‘Three new staff members are needed’

recrutements

faut
needs

(fr)

Impersonal constructions can also arise when an
intransitive verb is passivized (and the normal se-
mantic subject argument therefore suppressed).

In all of these cases, it is clear that the reﬂexive el-
ement does not receive a semantic role. In (15),
dosp´ıv´a ‘mature’ only takes one semantic argu-
ment, and in (16), the intended reading is clearly
not that the branch broke itself. We conclude that
these elements are expletives according to the def-
inition above. This is in line with the proposal of
Silveira (2016).

Inherent Reﬂexives

2.5
Many languages have verbs that obligatorily select
a reﬂexive pronoun without assigning a semantic
role to it:

(17)

(18)

se
REFL

confundiu
Pedro
Pedro
confused
‘Pedro was confused’

(pt)

(cs)

se
REFL

Smˇeje
laugh
‘he/she/it laughs’

There are borderline cases where the verb in ques-
tion can also take a regular object, but the seman-
tics is subtly different. A typical case are verbs like
wash. That there are in fact two different interpre-
tations is revealed in Scandinavian by the impossi-
bility of coordination. (19) is grammatical unless
seg is stressed.

(14)

(de)

Es

‘There is playing’

(19)

vasket
washed

*Han
He
‘He washed himself and the others’

seg
REFL

andre
others

og
and

de
the

(no)

In all these examples, the pronouns are clearly
non-referential, no emphatic reﬂexive is possible
and the form is selected by the construction, so
these elements can be classiﬁed as expletive.

2.4 Passive Reﬂexives
In some Romance and Slavic languages, a pas-
sive can be formed by adding a reﬂexive pronoun
which does not get a thematic role but rather sig-
nals the passive voice.

From the point of view of our deﬁnition, it is clear
that inherent reﬂexives (by deﬁnition) do not re-
ceive a semantic role.
It may be less clear that
they are non-referential: after all, they typically
agree with the subject and could be taken to be
co-referent. It is hard to test for non-referentiality
in the absence of any semantic role. In particular,
the emphatic reﬂexive test is not easily applicable,
since it may be the subject that antecedes the em-
phatic reﬂexive in cases like (20).

(15)

REFL-is

elle-mˆeme
Elle

herself
‘She herself remembered. . . ’

souvenue
reminded

In Romance languages, as shown by Silveira
(2016), these are not only used with a strictly
passive meaning, but also with inchoative (anti-
causative) and medio-passive readings.

Inherent reﬂexives agree with the subject, and thus
their form is not determined (only) by the verb.
Nevertheless, under the looser understanding of
the formal criterion, it is enough that reﬂexives are

21pronominal and thus can be expletives. This is also
the conclusion of Silveira (2016).

2.6 Clitic Doubling
The UD guidelines explicitly mention that “true”
(that is, regularly available) clitic doubling, as in
the Greek example in (21), should be annotated
using the expl relation:

(21)

einai
it-is

dikaio
fair

na
that

to
this-CLITIC

oti
that

pisteuˆo
I-believe
anagnˆorisoume
we-recognize

(el)

auto
this

The clitic to merely signals the presence of the full
pronoun object and it can be argued that it is the
latter that receives the thematic role. It is less clear,
however, that to is non-referential, hence it is un-
clear that this is an instance of an expletive. The
alternative is to annotate the clitic as a core argu-
ment and use dislocated for the full pronoun
(as is done for other cases of doubling in UD).

3 Expletives in UD 2.1 treebanks

We will now present a survey of the usage of the
expl relation in current UD treebanks.
In par-
ticular, we will relate the constructions discussed
in Section 2 to the treebank data. Table 1 gives
an overview of the usage of expl and its lan-
guage speciﬁc extensions in the treebanks in UD
v2.1.1 We ﬁnd that, out of the 60 languages in-
cluded in this release, 27 make use of the expl
relation, and its use appears to be restricted to Eu-
ropean languages. For those languages that have
multiple treebanks, expl is not always used in all
treebanks (Finnish, Galician, Latin, Portuguese,
Russian, Spanish). The frequency of expl varies
greatly, ranging from less than 1 per 1,000 words
(Catalan, Greek, Latin, Russian, Spanish, Ukra-
nian) to more than 2 per 100 words (Bulgarian,
Polish, Slovak). For most of the languages, there
is a fairly limited set of lemmas that realize the
expl relation. Treebanks with higher numbers of
lemmas are those that label inherent reﬂexives as
expl and/or do not always lemmatize systemat-
ically. Some treebanks not only use expl, but
also the subtypes expl:pv (for inherent reﬂex-
ives), expl:pass (for certain passive construc-
tions), and expl:impers (for impersonal con-
structions).

lect the data can be found at github.com/gossebouma/
expletives

The counts and proportions for speciﬁc con-
structions in Table 1 were computed as follows.
Extraposition covers cases where an expletive co-
occurs with a csubj or ccomp argument as in
the top row of Figure 1. This construction occurs
frequently in the Germanic treebanks (Dutch, En-
glish, German, Norwegian, Swedish), as in (22),
but is also fairly frequent in French treebanks, as
in (23).

Existential constructions can be identiﬁed by the
presence of a nominal subject (nsubj) as a sib-
ling of the expl element, as illustrated in the mid-
dle row of Figure 1. Existential constructions are
very widespread and span several language fami-
lies in the treebank data. They are common in all
Germanic treebanks, as illustrated in (24), but are
also found in Finnish, exempliﬁed in (25), where
these constructions account for half of all exple-
tive occurrences, as well as in several Romance
languages (French, Galician, Italian, Portuguese),
some Slavic languages (Russian and Ukrainian),
and Greek.

For the impersonal constructions discussed in Sec-
tion 2.3, only a few UD treebanks make use of
an explicit impers subtype (Italian, Romanian).
Apart from these, impersonal verbs like rain and
French falloir prove difﬁcult to identify reliably
across languages using morphosyntactic criteria.
For impersonal passives, on the other hand, there
are morphosyntactic properties that we may em-
ploy in our survey. Passives in UD are marked
either morphologically on the verb (by the feature
Voice=Passive) or by a passive auxiliary de-
pendent (aux:pass) in the case of periphrastic
passive constructions. These two passive con-
structions are illustrated in the bottom row (left

in Table 1 shows that impersonal constructions oc-

note that both Italian and Romanian also show a
high proportion of impersonal verbs, due to the
use of expl:impers mentioned above and ex-
empliﬁed by (27).

Both the constructions of passive reﬂexives and in-
herent reﬂexives (Sections 2.4 and 2.5), make use
of a reﬂexive pronoun. Some treebanks distin-
guish these through subtyping of the expl rela-
tion, for instance, expl:pass and expl:pv in
the Czech treebanks. This is not, however, the case
across languages and since the reﬂexive passive
does not require passive marking on the verb, it

is difﬁcult to distinguish these automatically based
on morphosyntactic criteria. In Table 1 we there-
fore collapse these two construction types (Reﬂex-
ive). In addition to the pv subtype, we further rely
on another morphological feature in the treebanks
in order to identify inherent reﬂexives, namely the
Reflex feature, as illustrated by the Portuguese
example in Figure 1 (bottom right).2 In Table 1 we
observe that the distribution of passive and inher-
ent reﬂexives clearly separates the different tree-
banks. They are highly frequent in Slavic lan-
guages (Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Polish, Slo-
vak, Slovenian, Ukrainian and Upper Sorbian). as
illustrated by the passive reﬂexive in (28) and the
inherent reﬂexive in (29). They are also frequent
in two of the French treebanks and in Brazilian
Portuguese. Interestingly, they are also found in
Latin, but only in the treebank based on medieval
texts.

It is clear from the discussion above that all con-
structions discussed in Section 2 are attested in
UD treebanks. Some languages have a substan-
tial number of expl occurrences that are not cap-
tured by our heuristics (i.e.
the Remaining cate-
gory in Table 1). In some cases (i.e. Swedish and
Norwegian), this is due to an analysis of cleft con-
structions where the pronoun is tagged as expl.
It should be noted that the analysis of clefts dif-
fers considerably across languages and treebanks,
and therefore we did not include it in the empir-
ical overview. Another frequent pattern not cap-
tured by our heuristics involves clitics and clitic
doubling. This is true especially for the Romance
languages, where Italian and Galician have a sub-
stantial number of occurrences of expl marked as
Clitic not covered by our heuristics. In French,
a frequent pattern not captured by our heuristics is
the il y a construction.

The empirical investigation also makes clear
that the analysis of expletives under the current
UD scheme suffers from inconsistencies.
For
the treebanks for Croatian,
inherent reﬂexives,

Czech, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, and Slovak
use the subtype expl:pv, while the treebanks for
French, Italian and Spanish simply use expl for
this purpose. And even though languages like Ger-
man, Dutch and Swedish do have inherent reﬂex-
ives, their reﬂexive arguments are currently anno-
tated as regular objects.

Even in different treebanks for one and the same
language, different decisions have sometimes been
made, as is clear from the column labeled Banks
in Table 1. Of the three treebanks for Spanish,
for instance, only Spanish-AnCora uses the expl
relation, and of the three Finnish UD treebanks,
only Finnish-FTB. In the French treebanks, we ob-
serve that the expl relation is employed to cap-
ture quite different constructions. For instance,
in French-ParTUT, it is used for impersonal sub-
jects (non-referential il, whereas the other French
treebanks do not employ an expletive analysis for
these. We also ﬁnd that annotation within a single
treebank is not always consistent. For instance,
whereas the German treebank generally marks es
in existential constructions with geben as expl,
the treebank also contains a fair amount of exam-
ples with geben where es is marked nsubj, de-
spite being clearly expletive.

4 Towards Consistent Annotation of

Expletives in UD

Our investigations in the previous section clearly
demonstrate that expletives are currently not an-
notated consistently in UD treebanks. This is
partly due to the existence of different descrip-
tive and theoretical traditions and to the fact that

24many treebanks have been converted from anno-
tation schemes that differ in their treatment of ex-
pletives. But the situation has probably been made
worse by the lack of detailed guidelines concern-
ing which constructions should be analyzed as in-
volving expletives and how exactly these construc-
tions should be annotated. In this section, we will
take a ﬁrst step towards improving the situation by
making speciﬁc recommendations on both of these
aspects.

Based on the deﬁnition and tests taken from
Postal and Pullum (1988), we propose that the
class of expletives should include non-referential
pro-forms involved in the following types of con-
structions:

1. Extraposition of clausal arguments (Sec-

tion 2.1)

2. Existential

(or presentational)

sentences

(Section 2.2)

3. Impersonal constructions (including weather
verbs and impersonal passives) (Section 2.3)

4. Passive reﬂexives (Section 2.4)
5. Inherent reﬂexives (Section 2.5)

For inherent reﬂexives, the evidence is not quite
as clear-cut as for the other categories, but given
that the current UD guidelines recommend using
expl and given that many treebanks already fol-
low these guidelines, it seems most practical to
continue to include them in the class of expletives,
as recommended by Silveira (2016). By contrast,
the arguments for treating clitics in clitic doubling
(Section 2.6) as expletives appears weaker, and
very few treebanks have implemented this anal-
ysis, so we think it may be worth reconsidering
their analysis and possibly use dislocated for
all cases of double realization of core arguments.
The distinction between core arguments and
other dependents of a predicate is a cornerstone
of the UD approach to syntactic annotation. Ex-
pletives challenge this distinction by (mostly) be-
having as core arguments syntactically but not se-
mantically. In chain constructions like extraposi-
tion and existentials, they compete with the other
chain element for the core argument relation. In
impersonal constructions and inherent reﬂexives,
they are the sole candidate for that relation. This
suggests three possible ways of treating expletives
in relation to core arguments:

1. Treat expletives as distinct from core argu-
ments and assign the core argument relation

to the other chain element (if present).

2. Treat expletives as core arguments and allow
the other chain element (if present) to instan-
tiate the same relation (possibly using sub-
types to distinguish the two).

3. Treat expletives as core arguments and forbid
the other chain element (if present) to instan-
tiate the same relation.

All three approaches have advantages and draw-
backs, but the current UD guidelines clearly favor
the ﬁrst approach, essentially restricting the ap-
plication of core argument relations to referential
core arguments. Since this approach is already im-
plemented in a large number of treebanks, albeit to
different degrees and with considerable variation,
it seems practically preferable to maintain and re-
ﬁne this approach, rather than switching to a radi-
cally different scheme. However, in order to make
the annotation more informative, we recommend
using the following subtypes of the expl relation:

1. expl:chain for expletives that occur in
chain constructions like extraposition of
clausal arguments and existential or presen-
tational sentences (Section 2.1–2.2)

2. expl:impers for expletive subjects in im-
personal constructions, including impersonal
verbs and passivized intransitive verbs (Sec-
tion 2.3)

3. expl:pass for reﬂexive pronouns used to

form passives (Section 2.4)

4. expl:pv for inherent reﬂexives, that is, pro-
nouns selected by pronominal verbs (Sec-
tion 2.5)

The three latter subtypes are already included in
the UD guidelines,although it is clear that they are
not used in all treebanks that use the expl rela-
tion. The ﬁrst subtype, expl:chain, is a novel
proposal, which would allow us to distinguish con-
structions where the expletive is dependent on the
presence of a referential argument. This subtype
could possibly be used also in clitic doubling, if
we decide to include these among expletives.

5 Conclusion

Creating consistently annotated treebanks for
many languages is potentially of tremendous im-
portance for both NLP and linguistics. While our
study of the annotation of expletives in UD shows
that this goal has not quite been reached yet, the

development of UD has at least made it possi-
ble to start investigating these issues on a large
scale. Based on a theoretical analysis of exple-
tives and an empirical survey of current UD tree-
banks, we have proposed a reﬁnement of the anno-
tation guidelines that is well grounded in both the-
ory and data and that will hopefully lead to more
consistency. By systematically studying different
linguistic phenomena in this way, we can gradu-
ally approach the goal of global consistency.
