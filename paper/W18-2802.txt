Abstract

A number of different discourse connec-
tives can be used to mark the same dis-
course relation, but it is unclear what fac-
tors affect connective choice. One recent
account is the Rational Speech Acts the-
ory, which predicts that speakers try to
maximize the informativeness of an utter-
ance such that the listener can interpret the
intended meaning correctly. Existing prior
work uses referential language games to
test the rational account of speakers’ pro-
duction of concrete meanings, such as
identiﬁcation of objects within a picture.
Building on the same paradigm, we design
a novel Discourse Continuation Game to
investigate speakers’ production of ab-
stract discourse relations. Experimental
results reveal that speakers signiﬁcantly
prefer a more informative connective, in
line with predictions of the RSA model.
Introduction

1
Discourse relations connect units of texts to a co-
herent and meaningful structure. Discourse con-
nectives (DC), e.g., but and so, are used to signal
discourse relations. In Example (1), the connec-
tive as is used to mark the causal relation between
the two clauses.

(1) That

tennis player has been losing his
matches, as we know he is still recovering
from the injury.

However, discourse relations can often be ex-
pressed by more than one DC, or not be marked
by an explicit connective at all (these are referred
to as implicit relations). For example, the connec-
tives since or because can alternatively be used
in Example (1). Note however that there can be

small differences in meaning between alternative
connectives: because stresses more strongly that
the reason is the new information in the discourse.
There is a large body of literature on the com-
prehension of DCs and unmarked discourse re-
lations (see for example Sanders and Noordman
(2000)), but the production of discourse relations
is under-studied. Patterson and Kehler (2013) and
Asr and Demberg (2015) investigate the choice
of using a DC vs. omitting it, and ﬁnd that ex-
plicit connectives are more often used when the
discourse relation cannot be easily predicted from
prior context. More recently, Yung et al. (2017,
2016) proposed a broad-coverage RSA model to
account for relation signaling, and showed that the
RSA-based modeling improves the prediction of
whether a relation is marked explicitly or not.

Nonetheless, it is still unclear, what factors af-
fect the speaker’s choice of a speciﬁc explicit con-
nective. Given the previous success of the RSA
account in predicting connective presence in a
corpus, we here set out to investigate whether
the choice of DCs follows the game-theoretic
Bayesian model of pragmatic reasoning (Frank
and Goodman, 2012). As broad-coverage corpus
analyses can be very noisy and can include a lot of
confounding effects, in particular with respect to
small meaning differences between connectives,
which we cannot control in a corpus study, we here
test for an RSA effect in a tightly controlled exper-
imental setting.

2 Background: The rational account of

linguistic variation

Natural language allows us to formulate the same
message in many different ways. The rational
speech act (RSA) model (Frank and Goodman,
2012; Frank et al., 2016) explains linguistic vari-
ation in terms of speakers’ pragmatic reasoning

ProceedingsoftheEighthWorkshoponCognitiveAspectsofComputationalLanguageLearningandProcessing,pages6–16Melbourne,Australia,July19,2018.c(cid:13)2018AssociationforComputationalLinguistics6about the listeners’ interpretation in context. Us-
ing Bayesian inference, the model formalizes the
utility of an utterance to convey the intended
meaning in context c. In our case, the utterance
is a DC and the meaning is a discourse relation r.
U tility is deﬁned in Equation 1:

U tility(DC; r, c)
= − log P (r|DC, c) − cost(DC)

(1)

− log P (r|DC, c) quantiﬁes the informative-
ness of DC, i.e. how likely the intended mean-
ing r can be interpreted by the listener in context
c. cost(DC) quantiﬁes the production cost of the
utterance. The probability that a rational speaker
chooses DC is proportional to its utility.
P (DC|r, c) ∝ expαU tility(DC;r,c)

(2)

According to the RSA theory, the rational ut-
terance should provide the most unambiguous in-
formation for the listener, and, at the same time,
be as brief as possible. These goals correspond
to Grice’s Maxims of effective communication
(Grice, 1975).

The RSA model has been shown to account
for speakers’ choice during production for various
phenomena, such as referential expressions (De-
gen et al., 2013; Frank et al., 2016), scalar impli-
catures (Goodman and Stuhlm¨uller, 2013), yes-no
questions (Hawkins et al., 2015), shape descrip-
tions (Hawkins et al., 2017) and uncertainty ex-
pressions (Herbstritt and Franke, 2017). In these
existing works, speakers’ utterances are collected
by experiments in the form of referential language
games. Although various types of speaker utter-
ances have been investigated, the intended mean-
ings to be conveyed in the experiments are com-
monly the identiﬁcation of concrete, visible ob-
jects or attributes, such as ﬁgures, colors and quan-
tities presented in pictures.

3 Methodology
In this work, we conduct language game experi-
ments to test the rational account of speakers’ pro-
duction of discourse relations. In contrast to pre-
vious approaches that use RSA to predict the pres-
ence or absence of DCs in corpus data (Yung et al.,
2016, 2017), we compare the theoretical choice
of RSA with the choice of human subjects. To
our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst attempt to manip-
ulate the production of abstract meanings in the
language game paradigm.

According to RSA, among alternative DCs that
are literally correct for a given intended dis-
course relation, speakers prefer the DC with larger
P (DC|r, c) and thus larger utility (Equation 2).
Since DCs are generally frequent expressions con-
sisting of no more than a few words, we assume
that the production cost for all DCs is constant.
Therefore, the DC that is more informative in con-
text (larger P (r|DC, c)) is the one preferred by the
speaker (Equation 1).

We use crowdsourcing to collect discourse pro-
cessing responses from naive subjects, following
previous success (Rhode et al., 2016; Scholman
and Demberg, 2017). It is, nonetheless, challeng-
ing to manipulate the intended meaning in a pro-
duction scenario, because discourse relation can-
not be presented visually, as in other referential
language games. We design a novel Discourse
Continuation Game that induces the subjects to
choose a DC, among multiple options with differ-
ent levels of informativeness, to convey a particu-
lar discourse relation.

3.1 Task and stimulus design

In each Discourse Continuation Game, the sub-
ject is asked to choose a DC as a hint for another
player, Player 2, who is supposed to guess how
the discourse will continue1. There are three pos-
sible continuations and three DC options in each
question. The subject (Player 1) is told that both
players see the possible continuations but only
Player 1 knows which continuation is the target.
Figure 1 shows the screen shot of one of the ques-
tions.

Figure 1: Sample question of the Discourse Con-
tinuation Game, under the with competitor condi-
tion. Continuation B is replaced by “he was close
in every match.” under the no competitor condi-
tion.

1We focus on speaker’s production in this work, so the lis-
tener, Player 2, does not exist. Fake responses are generated
by the system during the experiment. See Section 3.2.

7Each continuation option represents a discourse
relation and the target continuation is the discourse
relation we want the subjects to produce. For the
example in Figure 1, continuations A, B and C rep-
resent causal, temporal and concession relations
respectively.
The three DC options differ in the level of in-
formativeness in context, i.e. P (r|DC, c). For the
example in Figure 1, since is the ambiguous DC
because it can be used to mark the target contin-
uation A (causal relation), as well as continuation
B (temporal relation). As is the unambiguous DC
because, among the available continuations, it can
be used to mark the target continuation only. But
is the unrelated DC because it is used to mark con-
tinuation C, which is not the target.

When the speaker utters since, continuation B
can be seen as the competitor of the target contin-
uation A. We modify the informativeness of since
by replacing the competitor continuation with an-
other unrelated continuation. Under this no com-
petitor condition, both since and as are unambigu-
ous DCs for the target continuation A. The no com-
petitor condition serves as the control condition
because DC choice of a particular utterance can be
subject to other factors on top of informativeness.
By keeping the target identical and only manipu-
lating the set of alternative continuations, we can
control for ﬁne nuances in connective meaning: if
a connective is more suitable for marking the tar-
get continuation than another one, this will be the
same for both conditions.

Table 1: Level of informativeness of the DC op-

ple in Figure 1.

The level of informativeness of various DC op-
tions for target continuation A is summarized in
Table 1. When the speaker intends to convey the
discourse relation represented by continuation A,
both since and as are literally correct DCs, so both
DCs are similarly likely to be selected under the
no competitor condition. But, according to RSA

theory, the unambiguous DC as is pragmatically
preferred when there is a competitor in context.
We crowdsource responses of the Discourse Con-
tinuation Game to evaluate this RSA prediction.

3.2 Experiment
We constructed 36 stimuli similar to the exam-
ple in Figure 1, covering eight ambiguous DCs,
as shown in Table 2.

Table 2: List of DCs covered in the stimuli

Since many readings are possible if a discourse
relation is unmarked, to make sure that the stimuli
are valid, we conduct pretests by recruiting a sepa-
rated group of participants to ﬁll in any words that
connect the ﬁrst sentence with the continuation op-
tions. A stimulus is excluded or revised if, for any
of the 3 continuation options, any pretest partici-
pant ﬁlls in a DC that is among the 3 DC options
but is not the matching DC (or one of the match-
ing DCs for continuation A). The pretest makes
sure that: 1) all options are compatible with the
intended literal DC; 2) the target continuation is
compatible with both of the DCs that match it; and
3) continuation B and C are not compatible with
the DCs which are not their literal connectives in
the experiment.

The 36 stimuli (each in two conditions) were
divided up into 12 separate lists, each containing
6 items. Each participant saw 3 items in each of
the two conditions. An additional 6 ﬁller items
were added to each of the lists, resulting in a total
of 12 different questions in a list. The order of
items in a list was randomized. For each of the 12
lists, we collected 20 responses, resulting in a total

8of 240 native-English-speaking participants who
took part in the experiment. 127 participants are
females and 73 are males. Their average age is 34.
148 participants come from the United Kingdom,
34 from the United States and 18 from other coun-
tries, including Canada, Ireland etc. The partici-
pants were recruited through the Proliﬁc platform.
They took on average 8 minutes to complete the
task, and were reimbursed for their efforts with
0.8 GBP each. The ﬁller questions had the same
form as the stimuli, except that continuations B or
C were set as the target instead of the experimen-
tally interesting continuation A. Responses from
participants who chose more than 6 non-matching
DCs in their list were excluded and recollected.
The experimental interface was constructed using
Lingoturk (Pusse et al., 2016).

The experimental interface was designed to re-
semble a communication scenario where two play-
ers interact at real time, although the responses
of “Player 2” were actually automatically gener-
ated by the system, and were shown to the subject
with a time lag of 4 seconds. “Player 2” was pro-
grammed to be an rational Gricean pragmatic lis-
tener, who in the unambiguous condition always
chose the continuation that best ﬁts the connec-
tive, and who supposed that the speaker would
choose an unambiguous DC when there was a
competitor in context. For example, if the par-
ticipant chose the ambiguous since, “Player 2”
would guess continuation B, assuming that the par-
ticipant would have chosen the unambiguous as if
he meant continuation A.

To motivate the participants,

they were re-
warded with a bonus of 0.06 GBP for each ques-
tion where the “Player 2” successfully guessed
the target continuation.

4 Results

We calculate the agreement among the participants
for each stimulus by

Count(majority response)

Count(all response)

and average it over the items. The average agree-
ment of the ﬁller items is 87% while that of the
stimulus items is 68% and 71% respectively for
the no- and with competitor conditions. The agree-
ment of the ﬁller items is higher than that of the
stimulus items.
It is expected because only one
of the three connective options literally matches

the target continuation in the ﬁller items while two
of the options are literally correct in the stimu-
lus items. The agreement under the no competitor
condition is slightly lower than the with competi-
tor condition. This follows our prediction that, un-
der the no competitor condition, participants more
freely choose between the two literally correct op-
tions, because they are equally informative.

Figure 2: Distribution of participant responses.

The distribution of the participant responses is
shown in Figure 2.
In both conditions, most of
participants choose one of the connectives that ﬁts
the target relation (i.e., the ambiguous or unam-
biguous DC). This shows that our stimuli are valid,
because both options are literally correct for the
target continuation.
Also, the results show that the distribution of con-
nective choice differs between the two conditions:
In the no competitor condition, where both the am-
biguous and unambiguous DCs are similarly infor-
mative, speakers’ choice between the two options
is evenly distributed.
In the condition with the
competitor, the ambiguous connective is chosen
signiﬁcantly less often than in the no-competitor
condition. This is the expected effect according
to the RSA model, as the ambiguous connective is
less informative in the condition with the competi-
tor.

Moreover, we are also interested to see if there
is a learning effect as the trials progress. When the
subjects chose an unambiguous connective, a pos-
itive feedback was displayed to the subjects say-
ing that Player 2 correctly guessed the continua-
tion. Figure 3 shows the distribution of subject
responses grouped by the number of correct an-

the number of previous positive feedbacks exclud-
ing the ﬁllers

swers they previously got, excluding the ﬁllers. In-
creased preference for unambiguous connectives
is not observable; the subjects prefer an unambigu-
ous connective since the ﬁrst question and the ten-
dency persists until the end of the trial.

We test for signiﬁcance of the effects of the
with/no competitor conditions as well as previous
positive feedbacks on connective choice using a
logistic mixed effects model. Responses choos-
ing the unrelated DCs are not taken into account.
We included by-subject and by-stimulus random
intercepts, as well as random slopes for the effect
of the condition under both subject and item. The
regression values of the effects are reported in Ta-
ble 3. Statistical analyses were performed using
the lme4 package (Bates et al., 2015), version 1.1-
15. The with competitor condition was conﬁrmed
to have statistically signiﬁcant positive effect on
the choice of unambiguous DC, but no signiﬁcant
effect from the number of previous positive feed-
backs is detected. Further investigation is neces-
sary to evaluate the effect of pragmatic feedbacks,
possibly in longer trials of experiment.

To summarize, speakers do not have a prefer-
ence choosing either of the DC options that are lit-
erally appropriate for the target discourse relation
when both DCs are similarly informative. How-
ever, when one of the literal DCs is ambiguous in
context, the speaker chooses the unambiguous one
to facilitate listener’s comprehension. These re-
sults support the prediction of the RSA theory.

tion. According to the responses of subjects par-
ticipating in a specially designed Discourse Con-
tinuation Game, we found that speakers prefer a
more informative, less ambiguous DC when it is
necessary for effective communication. The re-
sults are consistent with predictions of the RSA
model, showing that speakers choose their utter-
ance by pragmatic reasoning when planning the
production of abstract meanings, such as discourse
relations. The results are also consistent with
the earlier broad-coverage model by Yung et al.
(2017), that speakers prefer to explicitly mark dis-
course relations when they predict that the relation
is hard to interpret if it is unmarked.

The Discourse Continuation Game successfully
extends the referential language game paradigm to
test the production of abstract, non-visible mean-
ings. A limitation of the current ﬁrst study is that
the alternative completions of the sentence are pro-
vided explicitly to the speaker and the compre-
hender, which is not the case in natural commu-
nication. Therefore, the current study only pro-
vides information on what humans can do, but not
yet necessarily on what they usually do in natural
communication. We plan to extend our work to
more realistic settings in subsequent work.
