Abstract

We present tools for lexicon and corpus management that offer cooperating functionality in cor-
pus annotation. The former, named Cradle, stores a set of words and expressions where multi-
word expressions are deﬁned with their own part-of-speech information and internal syntactic
structures. The latter, named ChaKi, manages text corpora with part-of-speech (POS) and syntac-
tic dependency structure annotations. Those two tools cooperate so that the words and multi-word
expressions stored in Cradle are directly referred to by ChaKi in conducting corpus annotation,
and the words and expressions annotated in ChaKi can be output as a list of lexical entities that
are to be stored in Cradle.

1 Introduction
This paper presents tools for corpus and lexicon management, especially based on syntactic dependency
structures. Annotating multi-word expressions (MWEs) in POS-tagged and/or syntactically analyzed
corpora pose a number of problems. Out of three dependency relations for MWE annotations deﬁned
in Universal Dependency (UD) (Nivre et al., 2016) 1, only the compound relation can deﬁne internal
syntactic structures, whereas the other two, fixed and flat, annotate MWEs with ﬂat structures.
Some issues of MWE annotation in UD are discussed in (Kahane et al., 2017). Since some MWEs have
clear internal structure and they themselves interact with other words in the sentence with their own
syntactic functionality, representing all their information solely in a dependency structure is not easy, or
even possible. An MWE may be included in another ﬂexible MWE. While an extended hierarchical BIO
annotation scheme was proposed in (Schneider et al, 2002), it still cannot represent nested interaction of
more than two MWEs.

In this paper, we do not discuss these issues in detail since the annotation standards are changing and
there can be several standards for MWE annotation. We rather introduce two annotation tools that we
are developing that are adaptable to various annotation standards as far as they are based on dependency
syntax. The examples we show in this paper adopt the Stanford Typed Dependency (de Marneffe et al.,
2008). One tool is a dictionary management tool named Cradle, which allows for the representation of
the internal structures of MWEs, and stores them as a lexical resource. The other is an annotated corpus
management tool called ChaKi, which communicates with Cradle and uses the stored lexical information
during the corpus annotation process. While both tools are language independent and are currently used
to develop English, Japanese, and Chinese dictionaries and corpora, we use English to explain how these
tools cooperate in handling MWEs in corpus annotation.

2 Dictionary Management Tool: Cradle
The tool called Cradle was developed to maintain multi-lingual dictionaries. It stores words (includ-
ing multi-word expressions), their part-of-speech labels, and additional information (such as inﬂection
types, lemma forms, and internal structures for MWEs). Other than the information about individual

words/expressions, it retains the derivation relation between a base word and its derived forms (for now
only inﬂected forms of verbs, nouns, adjectives, and adverbs) and the translation relation between pairs
of translated words in two or more languages.

In this paper, we focus in particular on how MWEs are represented in the system. MWEs are catego-
rized into ﬁxed expressions, semi-ﬁxed expressions, syntactically-ﬂexible expressions, and institutional
phrases (Sag et al, 2002). While all those types of MWEs can be handled in Cradle, we mainly focus on
the ﬁrst three types of English MWEs in this paper.

Figure 1 shows a snapshot of the start page of Cradle. When retrieving words or expressions, the
user can optionally specify the language and the name of the dictionary. MWEs are deﬁned as entries
that include more than one word. Regular expressions can be used for retrieving words/expressions. In
Figure 1, POS means part-of-speech and CType means the type of conjugation (or inﬂection). In the
case of English, it is either “regular” or “irregular” and is only deﬁned for verbs, nouns, adjectives, and
adverbs. Figure 2 shows the word information pane that shows the basic information of the retrieved
word (in this case “bring up”), its part-of-speech (POS), conjugation type (CType), and lemma form
(Base). In the case of MWEs, we can specify not only their basic information like POS, CType, and
lemma form, but also their internal dependency structures.
Examples of ﬁxed multi-word expressions are “with re-
spect to” and “lots of,” which behave as single lexical en-
tries with their respective parts-of-speech. The former be-
haves as a preposition and the latter behaves as a deter-
miner as a whole. Semi-ﬁxed and syntactically-ﬂexible
expressions may have modiﬁers within them or allow for
syntactic variations. For example, while “a number of”
behaves as a determiner, it has some variations such as “a
small number of” or “a large number of,” and both behave
as a determiner with additional meaning. Another ﬂexible
expression “take into account” behaves as a transitive verb
associated with a direct object, but is often used as “take
something into account,” taking a direct object within the
expression. Figure 3 explains how the dependency structures of such MWEs are deﬁned in Cradle. In
the ﬁgure, an asterisk deﬁnes a “placeholder” that matches any word. While it is not visible on this
screen, the POS tag information can be speciﬁed on the placeholder as a constraint. In the case of “a (cid:3)
number of (cid:3),” the ﬁrst placeholder stands for an adjective and the second stands for a noun. In the case of
“take (cid:3) into account,” the placeholder stands for a noun. The rightmost box without any word or asterisk
is a dummy box for pointing to the head word. The reason that the words are depicted as sequences of
characters is for handling non-segmented languages like Japanese and Chinese, in which annotators need
to segment a sequence of characters into words when they ﬁrst deﬁne the structure of MWEs.

Figure 2: Word information

In our English dictionary, we deﬁne an extended version of the POS tag set of PennTreebank (Marcus
et al., 1993). All the POS tags are deﬁne by two tag layers. For example, the POS tags of singular and

202plural nouns “NN” and “NNS” are deﬁned as “NN-NN” and “NN-NNS,” respectively. Similarly, “VBP”
and “VBD” are deﬁned as “VB-VBP” and “VB-VBD” so that the second layer corresponds exactly to
the PTB POS tags and the ﬁrst layer deﬁnes the coarse-grained tag groups. An adjective, a noun, and a
verb (in any form) are deﬁned as “JJ-(cid:3),” “NN-(cid:3),” and “VB-(cid:3).” Moreover, “a (cid:3) number of (cid:3)” and “take (cid:3)
into account” are deﬁned as a determiner and a verb for their own parts-of-speech.

Figure 3: Dependency annotation of MWEs in Cradle

Figure 4: Dependency annotation of “not only (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) but also (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)”

There are some MWEs that do not have an appropriate POS tag of their own. Our English dictionary
includes ﬂexible MWEs that do not stand for a single POS tag but deﬁne a complex syntactic structure.
One such example is “not only (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) but also (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1),” which constitutes a coordination. Figure 4 shows the
dependency structure associated with this expression. The two placeholders are the heads of the conjuncts
connected by this MWE. While they should share a common syntactic property such as a common POS,
the current Cradle does not provide such a functionality (equivalence relation between POS tags).

3 Corpus Management Tool: ChaKi

This section introduces a tool called ChaKi, which helps to annotate corpora with POS and dependency
information. It also offers ﬂexible search operations for sentences using character sequences, words with
various lexical properties, and dependency relations. Other than POS and word dependency annotation,
ChaKi is equipped with segment and group annotation functions. A sequence of words are put together
in a segment, and two or more segments are related in a group. A segment can be used to deﬁne named
entities or ﬁxed/ﬂat multi-word expressions. Two or more segments are related to form a group.

Figure 5 shows a snapshot of ChaKi when a user retrieves sentences that include the expression “but
also.” The top box shows the pattern of the sentence retrieval, and the middle window shows three
sentences that include this expression. The lowest window, the dependency pane, shows a part of the de-
pendency tree of the ﬁrst sentence. There are two groups as shown in this sentence: The ﬁrst corresponds
to “not only (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) but also (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)” (green boxes labeled by “1:MWE”), and the second corresponds to the coor-
dination structure conjoined by this MWE (orange boxes labeled with “2:Parallel”). Segment and group
annotation as well as other annotation such as the POS tag and dependency edge correction/modiﬁcation
can be done via mouse operations on this interface.

When we annotate MWEs that have speciﬁc syntactic functions like determiners or adverbs, it is not
only their internal dependency structure but also their dependency relation with other words in the sen-
tence that may need to be modiﬁed. For example, Figure 6 shows how the dependency annotation should
be changed after an expression is found as an MWE. The left-hand side shows the original dependency
tree. Note that the syntactic head of the noun phrase “a number of southern states” is “number” in this
tree. When “a number of” in this sentence is found as an MWE that functions as a determiner, they are to

203Figure 5: Snapshot of ChaKi in retrieving “but also”

be annotated in a group (shown by a green box) as shown on the right-hand side. Simultaneously, since
it is regarded as a single determiner, the head of the noun phrase should be “states” and the dependency
relations need to be corrected as shown in the ﬁgure.

While ChaKi offers intuitive mouse operations to annotate segments and groups and to modify depen-
dency edges, it is very tiresome to do the same operation when the same MWEs appear repeatedly in a
corpus. This is why we implemented the close cooperation of the above two tools, which is described in
the next section.

4 Cooperation between Cradle and ChaKi

To maintain the internal structures and other lexical information of MWEs and to utilize them for efﬁcient
corpus annotation, we implemented cooperation functions that connect Cradle and ChaKi. ChaKi can
refer to the information in Cradle in the annotation process. Suppose an annotator is working on POS
and dependency structure annotation or on the correction of the following sentence:

“Currently, a great number of electric cars are operating on Japanese streets.”

By pressing the MWE button, ChaKi presents a list of all possible MWEs and their positions in the
sentence by consulting the dictionary in Cradle; the MWEs and their positions are shown in Figure 7.
There appears a ﬂexible MWE, “a great number of,” in this sentence, and the list shows all possible
matching positions of this MWE. Note that it is deﬁned as “a (JJ-(cid:3)) number of (NN-(cid:3))” in Cradle.
Each line in Figure 7 corresponds to an MWE, its position. For example, the second line indicates that “a
(great) number of (cars)” matches with an MWE. The column “WordPositions” shows the word positions
of the MWE in the sentence, meaning that the position of “a” is at 2, and that of “number” is at 4, etc.
When a user selects a line by clicking the button on the “Apply” column, the dependency structure of the

204MWE is tentatively shown on the dependency pane. The user then presses the apply button (not shown
on the ﬁgure) to effect the annotation.

Figure 7: List of possible MWEs included in the current sentence

The left-hand side of Figure 8 shows the original dependency structure of the sentence before MWE
annotation. After checking the MWE list shown in Figure 7 and applying the second line, the annotation
on the right-hand side of Figure 8 is obtained automatically.

Figure 8: Before and after MWE annotation of “a great number of”

Currently, ChaKi can consult the dictionary deﬁned in Cradle and conduct efﬁcient annotation of
MWEs (as well as other lexical entries) as explained above. If the user does not ﬁnd any deﬁnition of an
MWE in Cradle, he/she can group the words together to form an MWE group, modify the dependency
structure, and output the result. The output format is based on the CoNLL-U format 2 with some addi-
tional information for MWE groups and their POS tags. The dictionary manager needs to examine which
MWEs are to be registered in Cradle, and may need to add additional information like POS constrains
on placeholders and modify the dependency structures if necessary.
5 Conclusion
This paper presented our tools for managing dictionaries and (POS and dependency) annotated corpora.
The system for dictionary management, Cradle, stores words and multi-word expressions together with
their POS and syntactic dependency structure information. The system for corpus annotation, ChaKi,
deals with POS and dependency annotated corpora to retrieve sentences and to modify or correct annota-
tions including MWE annotation. We presented the main functions of those two tools and introduced the
cooperation between them that is especially effective for MWE annotation by simply selecting possible
MWEs deﬁned in the dictionary.

There are several dependency annotation schemes in many languages, such as Universal dependency
and CoNLL dependency. Initially, our dependency deﬁnition adopted the CoNLL dependency and then
the Stanford dependency. Since MWEs often cause problematic cases of syntactic annotation, our frame-
work of managing MWEs and their syntactic information in a dictionary provides an easy and consistent
way of coping with deﬁnition changes or transferring one scheme to another.

Currently, Cradle is not publicly available, but is available on request. ChaKi is available from the
