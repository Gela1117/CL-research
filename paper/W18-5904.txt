Abstract

The goals of the SMM4H shared tasks are to
release annotated social media based health re-
lated datasets to the research community, and
to compare the performances of natural lan-
guage processing and machine learning sys-
tems on tasks involving these datasets. The
third execution of the SMM4H shared tasks,
co-hosted with EMNLP-2018, comprised of
four subtasks. These subtasks involve anno-
tated user posts from Twitter (tweets) and fo-
cus on the (i) automatic classiﬁcation of tweets
mentioning a drug name, (ii) automatic classi-
ﬁcation of tweets containing reports of ﬁrst-
person medication intake, (iii) automatic clas-
siﬁcation of tweets presenting self-reports of
adverse drug reaction (ADR) detection, and
(iv) automatic classiﬁcation of vaccine behav-
ior mentions in tweets. A total of 14 teams
participated and 78 system runs were submit-
ted (23 for task 1, 20 for task 2, 18 for task 3,
17 for task 4).

Introduction

The third execution of the SMM4H shared tasks
built on the success of the two previous shared task
workshops, which were held at the Paciﬁc Sympo-
sium on Biocomputing (PSB) in 2016 and at the
AMIA Annual Symposium in 2017. In line with
the previous shared tasks, the data comprised of
medication mentioning posts from Twitter, which
were retrieved using the Twitter public streaming
API. For this iteration, We designed and provided
annotated data for four tasks. The annotated data
were made publicly available for download. The
performances of participating systems were com-
pared on blind evaluation sets for each task.

1.1 Shared Task Design
Teams were allowed to participate in one or mul-
tiple tasks. In order to analyze cross-task appli-
cation of classiﬁcation techniques, all the tasks

for this year’s execution focused on text classiﬁ-
cation. Manually annotated training data for the
four tasks were made available to the participants
in May, 2018. Unlabeled evaluation data was re-
leased in July, 2018. Evaluations of participant
submissions were conducted from 29th July to 2nd
of August. In total, 14 teams participated in the
shared tasks and 78 system runs were accepted
from them (maximum of three submissions per
team per task). We received 23 submissions for
task 1, 20 for task 2, 18 for task 3, 17 for sub-
task 4. Participating teams were invited to submit
system descriptions to describe their approaches
to the tasks. We provide descriptions of the four
tasks and the associated data in the following sec-
tions/subsections.
2 Task Descriptions
2.1 Tasks
The primary goal of the SMM4H shared tasks is to
promote community driven development and eval-
uations of systems focusing on social media based
health data. This year’s tasks involved medication-
mentioning user posts from Twitter. We included
two tasks from the last execution at AMIA and two
new task. Outlines of the tasks are as follows:

1. Automatic classiﬁcation of posts mention-
ing a drug name.
In this binary classiﬁca-
tion task, the systems were required to dis-
tinguish tweets mentioning any drug names
or dietary supplement. Often run ﬁrst in au-
tomatic pipelines mining health related infor-
mation in social media, the performances ob-
tained on this task conditions the overall per-
formances of the entire pipelines and their
usefulness. This proposed task was new and
intended to establish common baselines for
future research.

2. Automatic classiﬁcation of medication in-
take mentioning posts. This is a three-class

Proceedingsofthe3rdSocialMediaMiningforHealthApplications(SMM4H)Workshop&SharedTask,pages13–16Brussels,Belgium,October31,2018.c(cid:13)2018AssociationforComputationalLinguistics13text classiﬁcation task. Each medication-
mentioning tweet is categorized into three
classes—deﬁnite intake (where the user
presents clear evidence of personal consump-
tion), possible intake (where it is likely that
the user consumed the medication, but the
evidence is unclear), and no intake (where
there is no evidence that the user consumed
the medication).

3. Automatic classiﬁcation of ADR mentioning
tweets. This is a binary text classiﬁcation task
for which systems were required to predict
if a tweet mentions an ADR or not. Such
a system is crucial for active surveillance of
ADRs from social media data as most of the
medication-related chatter in the domain does
not represent ADRs.

4. Automatic classiﬁcation of vaccine behavior
mentions in tweets. Speciﬁcally, English-
language tweets are classiﬁed to indicate
whether the user intends to receive a seasonal
inﬂuenza (ﬂu) vaccine (Huang et al., 2017). It
is a binary classiﬁcation task where the posi-
tive class indicates that the user has received
or intends to receive the current ﬂu vaccine,
and all other tweets (which are ﬁltered with
vaccine-related keywords) are labeled nega-
tive. Such a classiﬁer can be used to measure
patterns in vaccination behaviors across pop-
ulations.

To facilitate the shared task, we made available
large annotated Twitter data sets. The overall
shared task was designed to capitalize on the inter-
est in social media mining and appeal to a diverse
set of researchers working on distinct topics such
as natural language processing, biomedical infor-
matics, and machine learning. The different sub-
tasks presented a number of interesting challenges
including the noisy nature of the data, the informal
language of the user posts, misspellings, and data
imbalance. We provide details of the data used for
each of the four above-mentioned tasks, and the
tasks themselves, in the following subsections.

2.2 Data
The dataset made available for the shared tasks
were collected from Twitter using the public
streaming API. Task 1 and task 4 included new and
unpublished annotated datasets provided as train-
ing and testing sets. Tasks 2 and 3 re-used existing

training datasets from the SMM4H-2017 shared
tasks where the SMM4H-2017 shared tasks’ eval-
uation sets were included in the training datasets
used this year. These datasets had been made
available with our prior publication following the
execution of the past workshop (Sarker et al.,
2018).

Task 1: Drug names detection. Participants
were given tweets with binary annotation, indicat-
ing the presence or absence in the tweet of one
or more drug names/dietary supplement, manually
created. The data were released in two phases.
An initial set of 9,622 tweets were made avail-
able1 for training to any participants. The test set
composed of 5,382 tweets was distributed only to
registered participants. Both training and test sets
were balanced with 4647/2530 tweets mentioning
no drug and 4975/2852 tweets mentioning at least
one drug, respectively. All participants were eval-
uated using common metrics for binary classiﬁ-
cation: Precision, Recall and F-score for tweets
mentioning a drug.

Task 2: Medication Intake Classiﬁcation. Par-
ticipants were provided with tweets that have been
manually categorized into three classes: deﬁnite
intake, possible intake and no intake. Data was re-
leased in the same manner as task 1. 17,773 anno-
tated tweets were made available for training. The
evaluation set consisted of 5000 tweets. For this
task, the evaluation metric was micro-averaged F-
score for the deﬁnite intake and possible intake
classes. This metric was chosen for evaluation be-
cause the tweets belonging to these two classes
are of interest in social media based drug safety
surveillance systems, while the no intake class pri-
marily represents noise.

Task 3: ADR Classiﬁcation. Participants were
provided with the training/development set con-
taining tweets which were annotated in a binary
fashion to indicate the presence or absence of
ADRs. A total of 25,633 annotated tweets were
made available for training. The evaluation set
consisted of 5000 tweets. The evaluation metric
for this task was the F-score for the ADR class,
since the primary intent of this task is to be able
to ﬁlter out ADR indicating tweets from large
amounts of noise.

Task 4: Vaccine Behavior Classiﬁcation. Par-

1Due to Twitter’s privacy policy, the actual tweets were
not shared publicly. We made available the TweetIDs and
UserIDs for the tweets as well as a download script to down-
load all publicly available tweets.

ticipants were provided with two sets of annotated
data, one with 8,181 tweets and the other with
1,665 tweets, where approximately one third of
the tweets are labeled positive. Tweets were an-
notated with binary labels indicating whether the
user intends to receive a ﬂu vaccine. The evalu-
ation set consisted of 161 tweets. The evaluation
metric for this task was the F-score for the posi-
tive class, since the primary intent of this task is to
identify if someone has received a ﬂu vaccine.

3 Results
