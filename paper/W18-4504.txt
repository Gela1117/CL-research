Abstract

Should writers “avoid clich´es like the plague”? Clich´es are said to be a prominent characteristic
of “low brow” literature, and conversely, a negative marker of “high brow” literature. Clich´es may
concern the storyline, the characters, or the style of writing. We focus on clich´e expressions, ready-
made stock phrases which can be taken as a sign of uncreative writing. We present a corpus study
in which we examine to what extent clich´e expressions can be attested in a corpus of various kinds
of contemporary ﬁction, based on a large, curated lexicon of clich´e expressions. The results show
to what extent the negative view on clich´es is supported by data: we ﬁnd a signiﬁcant negative
correlation of -0.48 between clich´e density and literary ratings of texts. We also investigate
interactions with genre and characterize the language of clich´es with several basic textual features.

Introduction

What makes certain novels literary? Insofar as this is ascribed to the text itself, the text is said to exhibit
the phenomenon of literariness: the hypothesized linguistic and formal properties that distinguish literary
language from other language (Baldick, 2008). Others point to the prestige that publishers and critics
confer (Bourdieu, 1996). Empirical support for literariness as a textual property is presented by van
Cranenburgh and Bod (2017), who present machine learning experiments predicting literary ratings based
on a wide range of textual features. This paper zooms in on the contribution of one particular feature,
clich´ed language.

A direct way to investigate literariness would be to deﬁne a way to measure its particular properties such
as creative, original use of language. This is the aim of the Formalist tradition, which holds that poetic
language distinguishes itself from standard language by the phenomena of foregrounding and defamiliar-
ization (Mukarovsky, 1964). However, these phenomena seem diﬃcult to operationalize computationally,
at least without the collection of detailed human judgments. Text analysis can demonstrate how well a
large number of textual features (such as bag of word models and syntactic features) predicts literariness,
but due to the large number of features, the resulting model is hard to interpret (van Cranenburgh and Bod,
2017). By contrast, unoriginal language use can be readily detected, since it is by deﬁnition commonly
attested in data. Therefore we opt to investigate clich´es as a negative marker of literariness.

Clich´es in literature can manifest themselves at various levels such as narrative, style, and characters.
We focus on clich´e expressions at the sentence level since they are the most amenable to automatic analysis
using textual search.

2 Deﬁnitions & datasets

We deﬁne clich´e expressions as follows:
Definition. A clich´e expression is a ﬁxed, conventionalized multi-word expression which has become
overused to the point of losing its original meaning or eﬀect.

ProceedingsofWorkshoponComputationalLinguisticsforCulturalHeritage,SocialSciences,HumanitiesandLiterature,pages34–43SantaFe,NewMexico,USA,August25,2018.34Let’s unpack the main terms in this deﬁnition:

fixed: the expression in the form that is recognized cannot be changed, or only to a limited degree by

ﬁlling in speciﬁed open slots.

conventionalized: i.e., the phrase is recognized by many speakers as a unit, instead of being put together

word for word.

overused: this aspect is crucial but subjective and therefore harder to pin down. Many other multi-word
expressions are accepted as a normal part of the lexicon, while clich´e expressions are marked as
formulaic, tired, unoriginal, etc.

Cook and Hirst (2013) state that “a clich´e is a kind of ersatz novelty or creativity that is, ipso facto,
unwelcome or deprecated by the reader.” The term ‘overused’ might suggest that there is some range
of acceptable frequency for expressions, but this limit seems hard to determine; the clich´e-hood of an
expression rests on a tacit, cultural judgment.

The clich´e expressions we focus on are semantically compositional and syntactically regular, without
non-literal meaning. However, since they are conventionalized, their use provides evidence that the author
did not construct the expression word for word, but took a shortcut by employing a ready-made stock
phrase. The occurrence of such expressions may therefore be taken as a negative marker for creativity and
originality.

To operationalize the question of clich´e-hood we use a clich´e lexicon with 6,641 Dutch clich´e expres-
sions provided to us. This dataset is the source for a published collection of clich´es (van Wingerden and
Hendriks, 2015). In collecting this set of expressions, the focus was not on expressions that are established
sayings or ﬁgures of speech, but rather formulaic commonplaces for mundane situations—language that
does not necessarily stand out by itself but is recognizable as clich´ed by how typical it is for a particular
social situation.

We determine the frequencies of the clich´es in a corpus of contemporary novels and relate them to the
results of a survey investigating literary evaluations of the novels among the general public. The aim is to
see whether the prevalence of clich´e expressions oﬀers insights into literary evaluations. For example, to
what extent the intuition that less literary texts contain more clich´es holds up.

The dataset of novels was the subject of a large online reader survey (about 14k participants), to
obtain judgments of literary and general quality. This survey was conducted as part of the project The
Riddle of Literary Quality,1, investigating the textual characteristics of contemporary literature. The 401
recent Dutch novels (as well as works translated into Dutch) were the best selling and most lent books in
2007–2012. The corpus contains literary novels as well as genre novels such as thrillers and romantic
novels. The participants were presented with the author and title of each novel, and for novels they had
read were asked to provide ratings on a 7-point Likert scale from deﬁnitely not to highly literary. 96 % of
the novels have 50 or more ratings. In the following, we use the mean of a novel’s ratings as its literary
evaluation.

As reference corpora we will also look at Lassy Small and cgn. Lassy Small (Van Noord, 2009) consists
of written text (e.g., newswire and and Wikipedia text). cgn (van der Wouden et al., 2002) is a corpus of
spoken language.

3 Matching clich´e expressions

The process of searching through a corpus for a predeﬁned lexicon of expressions is an instance of
Multi-Word Expression (MWE) identiﬁcation (Kulkarni and Finlayson, 2011; Constant et al., 2017).

We tokenize both the clich´es and the novels to obtain a format of one clich´e/sentence per line with
space-separated tokens. Not all clich´es consist of a ﬁxed sequence of words; an informal notation is
used allowing for optional and variable elements. In order to work with this notation, we formalize it
into regular expressions. The following shows examples of the notation and its translation into regular
expressions:

1Cf. http://literaryquality.huygens.knaw.nl

35(1) a. Optional phrases: (. . . )

(Kijk,) dat bedoel ik nou.
(Look,) that’s what I mean.
(Kijk , )?dat bedoel ik nou

b. Open slots: [. . . ]

Geen [bier] meer voor jou!
No more [beer] for you!
Geen ([-\w+]* ){1,3}meer voor jou

c. Variables: X, Y

Y, zoals X dan zou zeggen.
Y, as X would say.
\w+ , zoals \w+ dan zou zeggen

d. Alternatives: A/B

Daar zit een boek/artikel in!
That’s material for a book/paper!
Daar zit een (boek|artikel) in

The vast majority of clich´e expressions in this dataset consist of full sentences (indicated by capital-
ization and sentence-ending punctuation). To avoid spurious partial matches, expressions with an initial
capital either have to occur at the start of a sentence, or at the start of quoted speech: (ˆ|’ ). Similarly,
expressions with sentence-ending punctuation have to end with a form of sentence- or quote-ending
punctuation: [.?!’"].2 To increase recall, leading and trailing interjections are made optional. Accented
characters (which can be used for emphasis) are also accepted in unaccented form. Where diﬀerent forms
of pronouns are possible, all alternatives are allowed (e.g., the possessive ﬁrst personal pronoun mijn and
its contraction m’n).

Some aspects cannot be translated precisely. When the alternatives span multiple words, the scope is
not speciﬁed, so these have been edited manually. For lack of more speciﬁc criteria, and to ensure the
regular expressions can be matched eﬃciently, we allow sequences of 1 to 3 words in open slots. Lastly,
some clich´es involve mini-dialogues; since we match on a per-sentence basis in the novels, these clich´es
will never be found.

After translating the clich´es to regular expressions we remove duplicates. A handful of expressions are
removed because they are too generic and generate too many matches (in these cases their clich´e-hood
depends on intonation or other contextual factors that cannot be automatically detected with textual
matching). The resulting list of 5,771 patterns are counted across the whole corpus. We use Google’s RE2
library to match the patterns eﬃciently using Deterministic Finite-State Automata.

4 Counting clich´es in novels
Counting clich´es in a corpus of texts results in a document-pattern matrix of occurrence counts. See
Table 1 for the most frequent clich´e expressions and expressions without any matches.

In order to get a picture of the overall rate of clich´es, we sum the counts for all clich´es in each novel,
and normalize them for a ﬁxed length (10,000 sentences) to get the clich´e density of a text. This value is
used to compute the correlation with the target value. See Figure 1 for the results. For both the literary
ratings and quality there is a signiﬁcant correlation (see the following section for how the strength of this
correlation compares to other textual features). The plots show that most novels with a high number of
clich´es are non-literary. The highly literary novel De Buurman (the neighbor) by Voskuil is the strongest
exception to this. This novel contains an exceptionally large proportion of dialogue, and the author is
noted for his realistic depiction of arguments. In this case the use of clich´es could well be a conscious
stylistic choice (contrasting with the characterization of clich´es as typically signalling ersatz creativity).
On the other hand, novels with few clich´es may or may not be literary. In other words, clich´es are a

2A reviewer pointed out that these restrictions may bias the results toward speciﬁc authors or genres. In order to rule this out,
we ran the experiments without these constraints, such that expressions only have to start and end at word boundaries. This did
not have a substantial eﬀect on the rates of clich´es for any of the genres.

negative marker of literariness. For example, 50 shades of grey, the least literary novel, has relatively few
clich´e expressions for novels with a similar rating, and falls below the regression line.

To compare the rate of clich´es across genres and domains, Table 2 shows an overview aggregated across
the main genres in the corpus and two reference corpora. The genres are derived from publisher-assigned
categorizations of the novels. ‘Fiction’ are novels marketed as literary ﬁction. ‘Other’ is a mix of genres
that did not ﬁt in the other three and does not form a coherent category. We will therefore focus on
analyzing Fiction, Suspense, and Romantic.

Especially the Romantic genre contains a larger number of clich´es: twice as much as the Fiction genre.
It also has more repetition of clich´es than would be expected from the total number: the number of clich´es
that occur more than once is more than twice that of the Fiction genre. This is also conﬁrmed by the lower
type-token ratio—a ratio of 1 indicates that each type of clich´e expression occurs only once; i.e., the lower
the ratio, the more repetition. The violin plot in Figure 2 illustrates the genre diﬀerences and the variation
within each genre. Fiction and Suspense, while having a diﬀerent mean, show a similar distribution, with

outliers of novels that have more clich´es (up to 65 and 80, respectively). The Romantic genre has a mean
that is skewed closer to its maximum.

The reference corpora contain a much lower rate of clich´es, which is probably attributable to their
domain and either lack of informal dialogue (Lassy Small), or transcription of disﬂuencies and punctuation
preventing matches (cgn).

5 Baselines features

We now consider simple baseline features, to characterize the language of clich´e expressions and to see
how clich´es compare and relate to simpler features when predicting literary ratings. By simple we mean
features that can be extracted from surface features without a trained model, as would be required for e.g.,
pos tagging, parsing, or named entity resolution. We consider the following four features:

Mean sentence length (number of tokens)
Common vocabulary the percentage of tokens part of the 3000 most common words in a large reference

corpus. We use word counts from Sonar 500, a 500 million word corpus part of Lassy Large.

Direct speech the percentage of sentences with direct speech punctuation.
Compression ratio the number of bytes when the text is compressed divided by the uncompressed size.

We use bzip2 compression with the highest compression setting.

Table 3: Simple textual features compared across the clich´es, novels, and reference corpora. The rows
with novels show the mean. *The speech corpus does not transcribe direct speech with quotation marks.

The ﬁrst two features represent a coarse measure of sentence and word complexity, respectively, similar
to traditional readability measures (e.g., Flesch, 1948). If literary novels would be more diﬃcult to read, we
would expect a large correlation with these. Direct speech is relevant since most clich´e expressions occur
in dialogue, which is therefore a potential confounding factor. Compression ratio, by operationalizing
repetitiveness, may also act as a proxy for clich´e density, similar to the n-gram method we will look at in
the next section (although it does not exploit an external reference corpus).

Table 3 compares the textual features for the clich´es found in the novels, the novels themselves, and
reference corpora. For each type of feature, clich´es stand out as having simpler language: they consist
almost exclusively of common words, are more repetitive (a lower compression ratio indicates more
repetitiveness), and contain shorter sentences. The high percentage of direct speech for clich´es indicates
that the majority of matched clich´es occurred as part of direct speech in the novels where they were found.
Compared to the diﬀerences between genres, the contrast with clich´es is much more dramatic.

These features can also be compared as predictors for the survey ratings; see Table 4. The degree to
which a novel is seen as literary is better correlated with the textual features than general quality, as was
observed before using clich´es. This indicates that this diﬀerence between the predictability of literary and
quality ratings is not speciﬁc to clich´es. The simplest feature, sentence length, has the highest correlation,
although clich´e expressions have a still higher absolute correlation (-0.48 vs. 0.40).

indicates a signiﬁcant result with p ! 0.001.

Table 4 also shows the correlation coeﬃcients of the number of clich´es compared to the simple baseline
features. All correlations are signiﬁcant, and the results are in line with expectations: novels with longer
sentences have less clich´es, more dialogue and more simple vocabulary is associated with more clich´es,
and a novel that is more compressible (a low ratio) tends to have more clich´es.

Since the simple features are correlated with the number of clich´es, these features are not independent
(i.e., they are collinear). On the other hand, the fact the clich´es have a higher correlation with the literary
ratings shows that clich´es pick up on more than the above features. This suggests that in addition to the
quantity of dialogue, the quality is also relevant, and the number of clich´es appears to be a proxy for

39the latter. Concretely, literary and non-literary authors exhibit a diﬀerent rate of clich´es given the same
amount of dialogue—literary authors tend to use less clich´e expressions.

It could also be the case that the diﬀerent genres employ diﬀerent kinds of clich´es. To investigate
this, we inspected the top 10 most common clich´es for each genre, and contrasted their frequencies. We
normalize the frequencies, i.e,. the counts of each clich´e are summed for each genre, and divided by the
number of books, to obtain the expected frequency per novel in the genre. The clich´es occurring in Fiction
novels are common across all genres. A few clich´es are common in both Suspense and Romantic, but not
Fiction:

(4) a. Waar heb je het over?

What are you talking about?

b. Is dat zo?

Is that true?

Only the Romantic genre has several characteristic clich´es that are rare in the two other genres:

(5) a. Dat meen je niet!

You can’t be serious!

b. Dacht ik al.

I already thought so.

c. Doe niet zo raar.

Don’t act so strange.

d. Ik red me wel.

I can take care of myself.

We conclude that, except for these outliers, the types and frequencies of clich´es attested in the diﬀerent
genres are generally comparable.

An interesting question beyond the scope of this paper is whether certain novels may deliberately use
clich´es for certain parts or characters, as opposed to the clich´es being part of the general style of the novel.

6 The n-gram distribution of clich´es

Our approach of relying on a list of clich´e expressions can be contrasted with Cook and Hirst (2013),
who present an automated method of assessing whether a text is clich´ed, using n-gram frequencies as
a proxy. Their method uses n-gram frequencies from a large reference corpus and does not require an
explicit list of clich´e expressions. This implies that their method can only conﬁrm a high density of clich´e
expressions, but not inspect the expressions themselves or analyze the number of types and counts for
each expression. We will test their method to see if the results hold up with our clich´e lexicon and corpus.
The method of Cook and Hirst (2013) is a corpus-based heuristic for clich´e density based on the
distribution of n-gram frequencies. We replicate their results on Dutch using n-gram counts from the
700 million word Lassy Large corpus (Van Noord, 2009); only counts of 2 and higher are included.
The n-gram counts were extracted using Colibri (van Gompel and van den Bosch, 2016). Note that our
reference corpus is signiﬁcantly smaller than the one used by Cook and Hirst (2013), which consists of 1
trillion words.

We will use this reference corpus to compare three samples of text. The ﬁrst two are written and spoken
text from Lassy small and cgn. The third sample of text is the set of clich´e expressions, i.e., a sample with
100 % clich´e density. Since the clich´e dataset itself consists of templates containing variable and optional
elements, we extract n-gram counts from a list of 2457 clich´e occurrences as attested in our corpus of
novels.

Figure 3 shows a comparison of n-grams from the list of clich´es versus samples from the spoken and
written reference corpora. The plots are histograms, shown as line plots to facilitate comparison. Each
histogram shows the absolute counts in a text sample (y-axis) of all n-gram tokens with a certain log
count in the large reference corpus (x-axis). Only counts of 2 and up are shown (i.e., hapax legomena and

Each text sample, written, spoken, and clich´es,
contains approximately the same number of tokens, to ensure that the n-gram counts are comparable.

We observe characteristic peaks for the clich´es in the mid to high frequency range, similar to those
reported by Cook and Hirst (2013); this is most clearly visible for 2–4 grams. The distributions of the
n-gram frequencies in the text samples are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent according to a Wilcoxon rank sum test
(p ! 0.001).

Diﬀerences with the graphs of Cook and Hirst (2013) are attributable to the fact that they use a larger
corpus, and use only n-gram counts of 40 and up, while we use a threshold of 2 on a smaller corpus.
Despite the diﬀerences clich´es do appear to exhibit a readily identiﬁable frequency proﬁle with n-grams
s.t. n ą 1.

Cook and Hirst (2013) argue that the n-gram heuristic is better because it is not possible to say whether
the sample of 1,988 English clich´es at their disposal has suﬃcient coverage. However, this is a precision-
recall trade-oﬀ. A manually curated dataset may have limited recall, but will yield higher precision (i.e.,
will contain fewer false positive). Moreover, the n-gram technique cannot be used to detect whether a
particular set of clich´es is present in a large text, and the clich´es cannot be located; the n-gram method
is therefore coarse grained. Finally, while the n-gram distributions can be used as a proxy for detecting
clich´ed language, it is not clear whether the peaks reﬂect clich´ed language speciﬁcally, or perhaps more
generally informal and colloquial language.

In Section 4, we found that two novels do not have any matches from the clich´e lexicon at all. To
conﬁrm that this is not caused by a lack of coverage in the clich´e lexicon, we use the n-gram distribution
method to conﬁrm that these novels do not contain clich´ed language. Cf. Figure 4 for the histograms of
the two novels without clich´e matches, a highly literary novel with many clich´es, and the clich´e dataset
itself. The two novels without clich´e matches indeed do not show the characteristic peaks of clich´es, while
the novel with many clich´es has a similar shape as the clich´e lexicon.

7 Conclusion

We conducted a large-scale corpus study of clich´e expressions in novels and reference texts. We conﬁrmed
the intuition that novels judged as more literary tend to use less clich´e expressions, and found a relatively
robust eﬀect. Clich´es predominantly occur as part of dialogue and consist of short sentences with simple
language. The clich´e density of a text is correlated with several textual features such as sentence length,
common words, and amount of dialogue, but the overlap is partial and the density of clich´es is a better
predictor of literariness than these other textual features. Non-literary genres such as suspense and
romantic novels were found to contain more clich´es.

The collection of Dutch clich´e expressions exhibits a distinctive n-gram frequency proﬁle, conﬁrming
results of previous research. Individual (unigram) word counts of clich´es are unremarkable compared to
reference texts, but higher order n-grams show a markedly diﬀerent frequency proﬁle.

Several interesting open questions remain. In general, what makes a particular expression a clich´e
expression? While we identiﬁed some basic characteristics of clich´ed language, it would be interesting to
try to model clich´ehood directly. In the particular case of literariness, it is interesting to dive deeper into
speciﬁc qualitative aspects, such as in what situations a clich´e may be more or less desirable stylistically.
