Background

Automatic checks of data quality

Machine Translation system needs
• a lot of training data
• high-quality training data

Manual check of bilingual data not feasible in practice
• Large size of data
• Quick turnaround
• Data scientist might not be bilingual expert
• Cost/benefit: worth spending manual effort on in-

domain data; not worth on out-of-domain data

=> perform automatic checks to validate data quality

The Associated Press Stylebook:

Automatic Filtering

Spell out the numbers one through nine; for 10 and up, use Arabic
numerals. For ages and percentages, always use Arabic numerals, 
even for numbers less than 10.

.... seriously, be careful there!

Dublin City University: „Numbers in academic writing“

For general academic writing, you need to write these numbers in 
words: all numbers under one hundred (e.g. ninety-nine) rounded
numbers (e.g. four hundred, two thousand, six million) and ordinal
numbers (e.g. third, twenty-fifth).

Duden (German) „Schreibung von Zahlen“

Eine früher gültige Buchdruckerregel, nach der generell die Zahlen von 1 bis 12 in 
Buchstaben und die Zahlen ab 13 in Ziffern zu schreiben sind, gilt heute nicht mehr!
A former rule from book printing, where all numbers between 1 
and 12 have to be written as words, and all numbers starting from 
13 as digits, is no longer valid!

do?

Standard cleaning procedures in 
MT community

Moses: open-source toolkit for statistical phrase-based MT

Clean training data and remove ...
• all words exceeding length threshold, 

e.g. 1000 characters

• all sentence pairs with

length(source)/length(target)>9 
or vice versa

• all sentence pairs where either source or target length

(in words) is outside given interval, 

e.g. [1,80]

Phrase table filtering

What do we do? 
Depends on use case, data, etc. 

•

Some options for phrase table filtering:
•
If a phrase consists of punctuation marks only:
the translation should also contain only punctuation marks
If a phrase contains quotation marks:
the translation should also contain quotation marks
If a phrase starts or ends with a special punctuation mark: the
translation should also start or end with it
Length ratio between source and target phrase should be within a 
certain range
For each placeholder type (NUM etc.): source and target phrase should
contain equal number of placeholders

•

•

•

Note that phrase table entries are normalized, tokenized & 
preprocessed

Hoang, C., & Sima'an, K. (2014). Latent domain translation models in mix-of-domains haystack. In Proceedings of
COLING 2014, the 25th International Conference on Computational Linguistics: Technical Papers (pp. 1928-1939)

Core idea: differentiate out-of-domain sentences (and 
implicitely, a lot of corrupt entries) from in-domain 
sentences

eBay Best Practices

Filtering out-of-domain data –
Invitation model

AMTA 2018 Tutorial: Corpora Quality Management for MTBoston, March 17, 2018   |   Page 17IBM-1-based filtering

1. Train a translation model („IBM-1“) on bilingual 

data

2. For each sentence pair in corpus, compute

translation probabilities in both directions (source-
to-target and target-to-source)

3. Sort all sentence pairs by this probability
4. Use top n% of sentence pairs

AMTA 2018 Tutorial: Corpora Quality Management for MTBoston, March 17, 2018   |   Page 18Edit distance
(aka Levenshtein distance, WER=word error rate)

eBay Best Practices

• Measure dissimilarity between 2 strings
• Minimum number of operations required to transform one string into the

other: substitution, deletion, insertion

• Takes word order into account

Position-independent error rate (PER) 

Filtering out-of-domain data –
PER

• Measure dissimilarity between 2 strings
•
• Difference in the count of the words between the 2 strings

Ignore word order, compare bag of words

=> Both are normalized by the length of the reference
string

AMTA 2018 Tutorial: Corpora Quality Management for MTBoston, March 17, 2018   |   Page 19PER-based filtering

1. Train MT system (or use existing one)
2. Translate out-of-domain corpus
3. For each sentence pair in corpus, compute PER 

between MT and existing target

4. Sort all sentence pairs by this distance
5. Use top n% of sentence pairs

eBay Best Practices

Filtering out-of-domain data –
PER

AMTA 2018 Tutorial: Corpora Quality Management for MTBoston, March 17, 2018   |   Page 20eBay Best Practices

Filtering out-of-domain data –
LangID

Language-ID-based filtering

1. For each sentence pair in out-of-domain corpus, 
automatically determine language of source and
target sentence

2. Keep sentence pair if

a. Source language correct or “unknown“
b. Target language correct or “unknown“

3. Remove all other sentence pairs

Language identification using the CLD2 tool.
Note that CLD2 is designed for longer sequences (~200 
characters) 
 does not work well on short sequences, search queries, 

lists of named entities, etc.

According to these conclusions, the Charter 
must contain three categories of rights. The 
first category is rights of freedom and equality 
and procedural rights, as guaranteed by the 
European Convention for the Protection of 
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.

This House therefore proposes the adoption 
of urgent measures encompassing all the 
relevant factors and to be applied 
immediately. We must ensure respect for 
human rights, tolerance and multiculturalism 
and we must obtain an increase in budgets 
and action lines for social and health issues.
They fly in the face of the very principles on 
which - as Mr Havel said yesterday - the 
European Union was founded: principles of 
liberty, democracy and respect for human 
rights.

Os Chefes de Estado e de Governo 
estabeleceram, nas conclusões do Conselho 
Europeu de Colónia, as grandes linhas do 
conteúdo da Carta.

Não esqueçamos, a propósito, que o 
agressor da vítima era um doente mental não 
devidamente tratado.

Claro que nestes últimos anos se fizeram 
progressos, mas temos de continuar a 
esforçar-nos juntos por criar um clima de 
tolerância, em que o racismo e a xenofobia 
sejam considerados totalmente reprováveis e 
inaceitáveis, ao mesmo tempo que tratamos 
com severidade incidentes como aqueles de 
que estamos a falar aqui esta tarde.

Senhora Presidente, nos últimos tempos falou-se muito da 
importância do alargamento da União Europeia.
Durante as primeira e segunda leituras do orçamento para 
2000, o Parlamento Europeu salientou que o novo título "pré-
adesão" (B7-0) proposto pela Comissão no anteprojecto de 
orçamento não deveria restringir-se aos países associados da 
Europa Central e Oriental, deveria igualmente ser alargado a 
Malta e a Chipre.
Nalguns países, há vinte anos, as crianças tinham mais 
probabilidades de acesso ao ensino básico e aos cuidados de 
saúde do que as que têm hoje.
O cidadão esperaria sem dúvida uma resposta do tipo: 
"defender melhor os países da Europa" , uma vez que essa é 
a missão tradicional e primordial da associação política.

EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE

Madam President, I voted in favour of the Schmidt report on the 
regulation of investments in transferable securities because, as I 
stated in this Chamber this morning, I consider it very important 
that the monies of the citizens of the European Union be put to 
good use. The vast majority of these citizens are elderly people 
and pensioners, who want a peaceful retirement and who, after 
the problems encountered during the course of their working lives, 
have at last found financial peace of mind.
The regulation of investments in transferable securities, the vast 
majority of which are made by elderly pensioners, is thus a major 
step forward for the European Union.

Constato que abandonou o hemiciclo, pelo que passamos de imediato às 
declarações de voto.
Senhora Presidente, votei a favor do relatório Schmidt sobre as disposições 
respeitantes ao investimento em valores mobiliários porque, como declarei esta 
manhã no hemiciclo, considero muito importante que seja bem utilizado o 
dinheiro dos cidadãos da União Europeia, que são, em grande parte, cidadãos 
idosos e reformados, que desejam viver serenamente a sua reforma e que, após 
as dificuldades encontradas ao longo da sua vida de trabalho, conseguiram, 
finalmente, a tranquilidade económica.
As disposições em matéria de investimento mobiliário, em grande parte

Edit Distance

Amount of change to get from one sentence to another

•

It can be counted in characters or words

• A case for words:
•
•

if you change a word out of 10, is it 10%? Yes
if you change a longer word, is it more change? No

• A case for characters
•

if you add an "s" to make a plural, did you change a whole word? No 

AMTA 2018 Tutorial: Corpora Quality Management for MTBoston, March 17, 2018   |   Page 521. Linguistic checks

Edit Distance

Amount of change between two texts

• Edit Distance is not normalized/proportional 

•

it is the number of words or characters changed

• Dividing by the total number of words will make it proportional, a % of 

the total "amount" (words or characters)

• This creates a "% of change“
• This takes into account the word order.

• There are several metrics, but most are based on a % of change

• TER - is the % of change in words
• PER - Position-independent error rate - independent of word order

Edit Distance

Amount of change between two texts
• Most importantly, any way you 
measure will show what is next

Edit Distance

Experiment

• Sample

• A number of segments that appear in the corpora before the 

misaligned ones (333)

• All the misaligned segments (1258)
• A number of segments that appear in the corpora following the 

misaligned ones (200)

• Source: EN
• Reference Target: EuroParl existing translation for PT
• 2nd Target: Obtained the MT for all segments

• Calculated the Edit Distance between Reference target and 2nd target
• Calculated the % of change

AMTA 2018 Tutorial: Corpora Quality Management for MTBoston, March 17, 2018   |   Page 551. Linguistic checks

Edit Distance

Experiment

• The expectation is that misaligned segments will not have anything to 

do with the machine translation, it will be very different

• The % of change (edit distance) will be very high

• Aligned segments will have an existing reference translation and a 

machine translation – different but similar

• So, lower % of change (edit distance) is expected

• The chart on next slide shows the % of change throughout the data

Misalignment

Translating the corpora and Comparing to itself

AMTA 2018 Tutorial: Corpora Quality Management for MTBoston, March 17, 2018   |   Page 571. Linguistic checks

Translating the corpora and Comparing to itself

• The finding of misalignments becomes language-

independent

• There is a decision to make:

•

fix the misalignment or delete the segments from 
corpora

• This likely requires language knowledge

• Whatever your decision, your corpora will be better than 

before.

Preprocessing checks

• Normalize escaped characters/entities

• Also for TMs

Escaped characters are representations 
of characters using only ASCII characters. 
For example, &#x20AC; is the escaped 
representation of the Euro symbol.

• Corpora ideally should not have 

escaped characters

Preprocessing checks

• Remove formatting tags for MT

• But not for TMs

• Formatting tags
•

<seg>When you click <ph x="1" type="x-LPH"/>Call me<ph
x="2" type="x-LPH"/>, we'll call you at a phone number you'll 
specify.</seg>

• Placeholders have meaning

• <seg>You declined <ph x="1" type="x-LPH"/>'s counteroffer of 

<ph x="2" type="x-LPH"/>.</seg>

• The problem: Some systems will not distinguish 
between them (as above) – TM Mgmt Taskforce

• The solution: space vs. no space

What the professional looks like
•

Should see “data”, beyond words

•

•

•

Should see numbers: edit distance, frequency

Should see patterns

Should know how to use tools
•
•

Frequency, QA, scripts
Not necessarily programming

• Maybe there will be a translator professional and a 

“[Your language here] data analyst” professional

Globalization, Internationalization, Localization, and 

Translation

Students in UTA's nationally-
known program in Localization 
and Translation program study 
localization, translation, NLP, 
NLU, CAT tools, and machine 
translation.  Learners build 
statistical machine translation 
engines for world languages, 
including Arabic, Chinese, and 
Korean.  Advanced research 
students explore natural language 
processing (NLP) and natural 
language understanding (NLU).

AMTA 2018 Tutorial: Corpora Quality Management for MTBoston, March 17, 2018   |   Page 79GILT Academic Certificate

Largest Undergraduate Program in GILT Nationally

Since 2007, more than 100 
undergraduate learners have 
graduated with the “GILT 
Certificate.”  Many of these 
students are pursuing 
“traditional” localization 
careers on the buyer or seller 
side, in roles such as as project 
mangers, localization sales, or 
linguistic talent as part of 
localization teams.

KantanMT at UTA

Students in UTA’s Localization 
and Translation seminar series 
utilize KantanMT to build 
statistical MT (SMT) engines, 
while exploring with Neural MT.  
Learners build engines in eight 
languages, exploring concepts of 
machine translation and the 
challenges of particular language 
or culture in the MT process.

AMTA 2018 Tutorial: Corpora Quality Management for MTBoston, March 17, 2018   |   Page 83Research Teams for Emerging 

Issues

Undergraduate students 
complete GILT research 
projects on topics such as NMT 
engine creation, sentiment 
analysis across languages and 
cultures, modeling language 
data, and issues of large-scale 
content archives in a multi-
national world.  UTA as a Tier I 
university encourages 
undergraduate research, which 
often disposes learners to further 
graduate study.

On the joys of unstructured data….

Natural language processing 
is a required component in 
the languages of study.  In 
their focus languages, GILT 
students learn preprocessing, 
sentiment analysis, topic 
mining, and other NLP tasks.

AMTA 2018 Tutorial: Corpora Quality Management for MTBoston, March 17, 2018   |   Page 86NLP (con’t.)

On the joys of unstructured data….

Students select to complete 
NLP tasks in a GUI interface 
(Orange) or directly in Python.  
Python workshops are lead by 
an unstructured data analyst at 
UTA, to foster the importance 
of programming in the arsenal 
of the future language 
professional.

AMTA 2018 Tutorial: Corpora Quality Management for MTBoston, March 17, 2018   |   Page 87“Language as Data” Mindset

Traditional language students prepare for MT/ML/AI markets.

Critical to preparing students 
for emerging MT and ML/AI 
markets is a “language as 
data” mindset.  Students in 
the GILT track move away 
from traditional academic 
orientations in literature and 
linguistics to language data 
collection, preparation, 
analysis and application.

eBay and Bilingual Data 

Colleagues at eBay, users of 
KantanMT and MT engineers, 
volunteered to teach data quality 
and data cleaning to GILT 
students.  Via Zoom, MT specialists 
and engineers from eBay sites in 
California and Berlin joined the 
U.S.-based learners to share 
common problem and tools sets, as 
well as recent applied research.

eBay and Bilingual Data 

After demonstrations from eBay 
colleagues, UTA students are 
utilizing Okapi/Checkmate and 
Heartsome to clean bilingual 
data from Opus, then rebuilding 
KantanMT engines.  Learners are 
considering QA topics:  linguistic 
and terminology themes, 
inconsistency, alignment, and 
other issues.
