Abstract 

In this paper, for the purpose of enhancing 
Universal  Dependencies  for  the  Korean 
language, we propose a modified method 
for mapping Korean Part-of-Speech(POS) 
tagset  in  relation  to  Universal  Part-of-
Speech (UPOS) tagset in order to enhance 
the Universal Dependencies for the Korean 
Language.  Previous  studies  suggest  that 
UPOS reflects several issues that influence 
dependency annotation by using the POS 
of  Korean  predicates,  particularly  the 
distinctiveness in using verb, adjective, and 
copula. 

Introduction 

1 
The Universal Dependencies (UD) approach aims 
to find morphological and syntactic characteristics 
that can be applied to several languages for cross-
lingual 
language  processing.  This  approach  
converts the language resources of each language 
has into one unified format (CoNLL U-Format) in 
order to simplify general language processing. 

The number of language resources varies among 
all  languages.  Designed  with  a  focus  on  the 
characteristics  of  resource-rich  languages,  the  
CoNLL U-Format does not completely reflect the 
distinctiveness of Korean annotation. The CoNLL 
U-Format sets up minimum processing unit based 
on eojeol (white space), However, in Korean, the 
basic  unit  for  language  processing  is  not  only 
eojeol  but  the  also  morphemes  with  eojeol. 
Therefore, an analysis of the Korean language with 
white space as the minimum unit may lead to the 
omission of some important information, or yield 
inaccurate results. 

In  Korean,  the  unit  divided  by  white  space  is 
called eojeol, this is composed of a noun or verb 
stem combined with a postposition (josa) or ending

as 

that 

function 

inflectional 

(eomi) 
and 
derivational  particles. Significantly, based  on the 
type of ending with which the stem of the predicate 
is combined to form an eojeol, the eojeol takes on 
different functions. Therefore, this paper suggests 
that Universal Part-of-speech (UPOS) be analyzed 
by taking this characteristic into consideration. 

The CoNLL U-Format assigns a UPOS to each 
eojeol, and marks it with a language-specific part-
of-speech  tag  (XPOS)  beside  it.  This  paper 
suggests a methodology that is able to clarify the 
UPOS  and  Dependency  annotation  by  using  
XPOS after processing the Korean language. 

For the purpose of enhancing Korean UD, the 
focus should be on the processing of predicates. In 
the  Korean,  most  predicates  consist  of  the 
combination  of  a  stem  and  an  ending,  which  is 
similar  to  Japanese  predicate  construction  but 
differs  from 
that  of  English  and  European 
languages.  However,  unlike  Japanese  text  which 
can be segmented into stem and ending separately 
to  give  UPOS,  as there is  no white space in the 
language itself, Korean text includes a white space 
unit which has a construction that is different from 
English, and thus, we should consider this specific 
property. 

This paper suggests a scheme for the mapping 
of part-of-speech that forms Korean predicates on 
UPOS, as well as suggests a method of annotating 
the dependency relations in case of verb sequences. 
In section 2, we examine the attempts to convert 
and  build  Korean  language  resources  into  UD. 
Furthermore, based on an analysis of the contents 
of previous Part-of-Speech (POS) annotations and 
dependency  annotations,  we  search  for 
the 
necessary  areas  of  improvement  for  Korean 
annotation. In section 3, we suggest a UPOS for 
several  issues  that  can  have  influences  the 
dependency annotation by using XPOS of Korean 
predicates. In section 4, we will suggest a Korean

suggested UPOS. 

2  Previous works 
Since the late 1990s, there have been attempts to 
build  a  syntactic  parsing  corpus  of  the  Korean 
language  based  on  the  dependency  structure. 
Korean  National  Corpus  in  the  21st  Century 
Sejong Project (KNC), which has been established 
and  is  the  most  well-known  syntactic  parsing 
corpus, is based on the binary phrase structure and 
can easily to be converted to have a dependency 
structure. In fact, the dependency structure analysis 
corpus has been used widely in Korean language 
processing, and with a recent attempt  to unify its 
form  with  UD.  The  efforts  to  apply  current  tag 
system of UD to the Korean language began with 
the Google Universal Dependency Treebank (UDT) 
Project (McDonald et al., 2013), which attempted 
to  combine  the  Stanford  Tag  System  and  the 
Google System. 

(PUD),  and 

This paper discusses a total of three corpora: the 
Google  Korean  Universal  Dependency  Treebank 
(GKT), the Parallel Universal Korean Dependency 
Treebank 
the  KAIST  Korean 
Universal Dependency Treebank (KTB). All of the 
three  corpora  were  tagged  in  CoNLL  U-Format. 
The  Google  Korean  Universal  Dependency 
Treebank  was  first  converted  from  the  Universal 
Dependency  Treebank  v2.0  (legacy),  and  then 
enhanced  by  Chun  et  al.  (2018).  The  KAIST 
Korean  Universal  Dependency  Treebank  was 
generated  by  Chun  et  al.  (2018)  from  the 
constituency-based  trees  in  the  KAIST  Tree-
Tagging  Corpus.  The  Parallel  Universal 
Dependencies  (PUD)  treebanks  are  created  from 
Raw  Text  to  Universal  Dependencies  for  the 
CoNLL 2017 shared task on Multilingual Parsing. 
As stated in the Introduction, it is necessary to 
focus on predicate processing for enhanced Korean 
UD. Therefore, in section 2, this paper, examines 
GKT, PUD,  and  KTB  centered  on  predicates;  In 
2.1, we will compare and analyze POS annotation 
methods of eojeols containing predicates in three 
corpora;  and 
in  2.2,  we  will  examine  the 
Dependency  annotation  methods  of  these  three 
corpora for eojeols containing predicates. 
2.1  Part-of-speech annotation  
For  the  POS  annotation  of  eojeols  containing 
predicates,  all  GKT,  PUD,  and  KTB  currently 

in 

the  function  of 

published on the UD Website follow the types of 
the  eojeols  without 
predicates  contained 
considering 
the  eojeols.  It 
designates itself as VERB  if  the predicate in the 
eojeol is a verb and designates itself as ADJ if the 
predicate in the eojeol is an adjective, similar to the 
process of lemmatization. 
 
(1) GKT Example - UPOS annotation as VERB for 
verb (VV) contained eojeol

For  copula,  GKT  and  KTB  adopt  a  similar 
methods  of  POS  annotation  while  PUD  takes 
different one. GKT and KTB label all eojeols that 
contain copula as VERB; however, PUD segments 
the copula from eojeols and assigns an AUX.

copula (VCP) contained eojeol

In  addition,  GKT  and PUD tag  both the main

2.2  Dependency annotation 
Of the 37 universal syntactic relations labels that 
represent Universal Dependency Relations, GKT, 
PUD, and KTB show the biggest difference in the 
aux (Auxiliary) and labels related to MEW (multi-
word-expression),  compound 
(Compound), 
fixed (Fixed Multiword Expression), and flat 
(Flat  Multiword  Expression).  GKT  demonstrates 
quite a low frequency of aux, which is because 
auxiliary predicates are not classified separately in 
the POS annotation process but are processed with 
VERB.  Since  an  auxiliary  predicate  is  not  used 
alone but appears next to the main predicate, AUX 
which is a POS tag, and aux, which is a label and 
syntactic tag, should be proportional to each other. 
As  such,  it  is  natural  for  aux  to  show  high 
frequency,  as  is  the  case  with  KTB.  Instead,  a 
flat label appears in GKT with high frequency 
whereas  it  appears  with  low  frequency  in  other 
corpus  as  the  relationship  between  the  auxiliary 
predicate  and the main predicate  is  processed  as 
flat. 

In this way, the Korean language has a predicate 
formed  with  continual  eojeols  in  several  cases; 
therefore 
to  establish 
dependency relations between eojeols that form a 
predicate in the Korean language. 

it  becomes  critical

3  Part-of-speech annotation 
The target of this paper is limited only to the POS 
that can be used as a predicate in a sentence. In the 
Korean  language,  the  POS  applicable  to  the 
predicates are verb, adjective, copula, and auxiliary. 
The  predicates  of  the  Korean  language  can  be 
composed of either a single eojeol or multiple ones. 
In the former case, one eojeol composed of a stem 
and ending with a verb or adjective functions as a 
predicate; alternatively, noun and copula combined 
with ending form an eojeol. In the latter case, stems 
of the main verb and auxiliary verbs are combined 
with  an  ending  forming  two  or  more  eojeols  in 
sequence, or many types of main verb stems are 
combined  with  an  ending  forming  two  or  more 
eojeols in a sequence. 

and 

syntactic 

In  this  manner,  the  Korean  language  is  very 
diverse in terms of predicate configurations; as the 
functions  of 
morphological 
predicate-related  POS 
these 
configurations  are  different,  the  POS  annotation 
method in the prior process of parsing becomes an 
important issue that influences  clear dependency 
annotation thereafter.

1103.1  Verb 
A  Korean  verb  stem  cannot  be  used  alone  in  a 
sentence; it must be combined with an ending to 
form  an  eojeol.  The  types  of  ending  are  broadly 
categorized into final endings, connective endings, 
and  conversion  endings,  and  the  function  of  an 
eojeol  in  a  sentence  is  dependent  on  the  ending 
with which the stem is combined. When combined 
with  a  final  or  connective  ending,  it  has  the 
function of a predicate, whereas it has the function 
of  a  modifier  or  substantive  on  being  combined 
with a conversion ending. 

As described in  section 2, in  GKT,  KTB,  and 
PUD, eojeols that contain Korean verbs are mostly 
tagged as VERB regardless of the type of ending 
that is combined with the verb stem. This simple 
labeling  method  does  not  consider  the  actual 
function of an eojeol in which the verb is contained. 
When this approach is used, the POS annotation is 
very likely to become redundant, which does not 
improve 
the  dependency 
annotation. 

the  accuracy  of 

This paper suggests that POS annotation should 
be  performed  according  to  the  function  of  each 
eojeol  within  a  sentence.  In  an  eojeol  where  the 
verb  stem  functions  as  a  predicate  by  being 
combined  with  a  final  or  connective  ending,  the 
POS tag of VERB can be given. On the other hand, 
in  an  eojeol  where  the  verb  stem  functions  as 
modifying the following noun by being combined 
with an adnominal ending, the POS tag of ADJ can 
be  given. When a  verb stem is  combined with  a 
nominal ending, the function of the eojeol can be 
changed  according  to  the  type  of  combined 
inflectional particle.  

information 

in  deciding 

Therefore, the POS tag of the eojeol follows the 
type  of  the  combined  inflectional  particle.  For 
helpful 
the  POS 
annotation of each eojeol, we can refer to the KNC 
POS  tagset,  which analyzes  eojeol  in morpheme 
units. Specifically, if the morpheme unit annotation 
of an eojeol is “VV (verb) + EF (final ending)” or 
“VV  +  EC  (connective  ending)”,  the  UPOS  of 
VERB is allotted; if the morpheme unit annotation 
is “VV + ETM (adnominal ending)”, the tag ADJ 
is allotted.  

However,  among  other  connective  endings 
combined with verb stem, “-게 (-ge)” provides an 
adverbial function to the eojeol, and it can often be 
tagged as ADV rather than VERB. It is the same in 
the  case  of  the  adjective  and  copula  below.  An 
eojeol  made  with  a  verb  stem  combined  with  a 

nominal  ending  and  inflectional  particle  can  be 
tagged with NOUN if it is “VV + ETN (nominal 
ending)  +  {JKS  (subjective  case  particle),  JKC 
(compliment  case  particle),  JKO  (objective  case 
particle), JC (conjunctive particle)},” with ADJ if 
“VV + ETN + JKG (adjective case particle)”, and 
with ADV if “VV + ETN + JKB (adverbial case 
particle)”. The POS assignment method described 
above is applied only when the eojeol is not a part 
of a paragraph that presupposes a subject-predicate 
relation.  

By following this method, more accurate UPOS 
annotation can be obtained by using morphological 
annotation information of the existing KNC. The 
UPOS  established  in  this  way  would  also  be 
helpful in determining the dependencies relations.

3.2  Adjective 

Unlike  English  adjectives,  Korean  adjectives 
are sometimes classified as stative verbs, because 
a  Korean  adjective  can  function  as  predicate 
without  a  support  verb.  Therefore,  it  is  hard  to 
apply ADJ of UPOS to intact Korean adjectives. 
An  English  adjective  does  not  change  its  form 
depending on whether it takes the role of predicate 
or modifier, and it can even form an eojeol on its 
own. Hence, it does not result in problem if it is 
tagged as ADJ. However, a Korean adjective stem, 
just like a verb, can complete an eojeol and be used 
in  a  sentence  only  when  it  is  combined  with  an 
ending, and its function within the sentence can be 
changed based on the type of ending it is combined 
with. 

In  GKT,  PUD,  and  KTB,  eojeols  that  contain 
Korean  adjectives  are  mostly  tagged  as  ADJ 
regardless of the type of ending that is combined 
with  the  adjective  stem  in  the  sentence,  or  the 
function  of  the  eojeol,  in  which  the  adjective  is 
contained. Sometimes, an eojeol that functions as 
a predicate rather than a modifier is tagged as ADJ; 
and  if  this  eojeol  containing  an  adjective  which 
functions as a predicate by being combined with a 

111final  ending  or  connective  ending,  is  tagged  as 
POS of ADJ, the sentence becomes a non-sentence, 
as it does not have a predicate. 

Focusing  on 

this  characteristic  of  Korean 
adjectives,  this  paper  suggests  performing  POS 
annotation for an eojeol that contains an adjective 
based  on  the  function  of  the  eojeol  within  the 
sentence. The approach is to annotate an eojeol in 
which  an  adjective  stem  functions  as  a  predicate 
within  a  sentence  when  combined  with  a  final  or 
connective  ending  as  VERB,  and  to  annotate  an 
eojeol  in  which  an  adjective  stem  functions  as  a 
modifier  within  sentence  by  being  combined  with 
adnominal ending as ADJ.  

As stated above, Korean adjectives are analogous 
with stative verbs;  hence, if one is combined with a 
final or connective ending, it functions as a predicate 
within a sentence. Therefore, a UPOS annotation as 
VERB is not irrational in the least, and it is suitable 
to  give  an  ADJ  tag  to  an  eojeol  that  modifies  a 
following  eojeol  by  being  combined  with  an 
adnominal ending. In addition, if an adjective stem 
is combined with a nominal ending, in the manner 
described  in  section  3.1,  its  function  is  changes 
according to the type of postposition with which it is 
combined; therefore, the POS of the eojeol can be 
determined according to the type of postposition.

An  eojeol  containing  an  adjective  can  also  be 
annotated by referring to the KNC POS tagset that 
performs  analysis 
in  morpheme  units.  This 
information  will  be  helpful  in  clarifying  the 
dependency relations of a sentence by being used in 
dependency annotation. 
3.3  Copula 
The Korean copula “-이-(-i-)” is a unique POS that 
gives a predicate function to a noun. It appears with 
a noun and is similar to the English verb “be,” as it 
has the function of a predicate. But unlike the verb 
“be”  which  functions  as  a  predicate  alone  by 
forming an eojeol without a noun, it can form an 
eojeol  only by  forming a  “noun+copula+ending” 

structure. In addition, Korean copula, just like verb 
stem or adjective stem, can function as a predicate 
by combining it with a final or connective ending, 
or as a modifier or substantive by combining with 
a conversion ending. 

In  GKT  and KTB,  eojeols that contain  copula 
are mostly tagged as VERB regardless of the type 
of ending that is combined with copula, similar to 
the eojeols that contain a Korean verb; in PUD, a 
copula is segmented from the eojeol and tagged as 
AUX.  The  former  does  not  consider  the  actual 
function of the eojeol containing the copula, and 
the  latter  takes  a  method  out  of  UD’s  POS 
annotation guideline, which considers the eojeol as 
a basic unit. 

This  paper  suggests  differentiating  the  POS 
annotation of eojeols that contain copula according 
to the function of the eojeol in a sentence, just like 
the Korean verb or adjective stated above. To be 
specific,  if  an  ending  that  completes  an  eojeol 
located next to a “noun+copula” structure is a final 
or connective ending when the eojeol functions as 
a  predicate  within  the  sentence,  it  is  tagged  as 
VERB;  if  the  adnominal  ending  functions  as  a 
modifier, it is tagged as ADJ; and if combined with 
a  nominal  ending,  POS  annotation  is  done 
according to the type of inflectional particle. Here, 
we  can  also  refer  to  the  KNC  POS  tagset  that 
annotates  Korean  language  in  morpheme  units. 
Unlike Korean verbs or adjectives, the KNC POS 
tagset analysis on the eojeol containing copula that 
forms an eojeol by combining it  with a noun would 
be  like  “NN*  (noun)  +  VCP  (copula)  +  E* 
(ending).”

3.4  Auxiliary 
The  Korean  auxiliary  verb  is  different  from  the 
English auxiliary verb in several respects. Firstly,  
most English  auxiliary  verbs take  forms that are 
different  from  main  verbs;  however  in  several 
cases, Korean auxiliary verbs are homonyms that

language 
“main  verb||auxiliary  verb” 
combinations  and  “main  verb||main  verb” 
combinations, these  combinations  have the same 
syntactic structure in the Korean Language. Finally, 
in  principle  the  Korean  auxiliary  verb  is  written 
with a space separating it from the main  verb in 
order to form a separate eojeol, but sometimes it 
forms one eojeol with main verb in order to take 
the function of one predicate.

understand which one of two eojeols takes the role 
of  the  main  predicate  and  which  one  takes  the

This  paper  suggests  applying  different  tags  to 
the “main verb||main verb” combinations as wel as 
the  “main verb||auxiliary verb” combinations by 
strictly  classifying  both  of  them.  Sometimes  the 
form of a Korean auxiliary verb is difficult to be 
distinguished from the main verb, but it is a closed 
set and small in number. In the KNC POS tagset 
that  analyzes  the  Korean  language  in  morpheme 
units, the main verb stem is tagged as VV or VA 
while the auxiliary verb is tagged as VX; Using this 

information,  we  can  clearly  and  simply  classify 
main  verbs  and  auxiliary  verbs  in  UD  POS 
annotation. Therefore, the main verb can be tagged 
by  VERB  and  the  auxiliary  verb  by  AUX,  and 
when a main verb and an auxiliary verb form an 
eojeol,  it  can  be  tagged  as  VERB  without 
segmenting the eojeol.

113Because  the  UPOS  is  based  on  information  of 
XPOS  inside  CoNLL  U-Format,  it  can  be 
automatically converted. The eojeol contaning VV 
showed the  highest conversion  rates to ADJ  and 
ADV.  And  for  eojeols  contaning  VA, 
the 
conversion rates to VERB and ADV was highest. 
In  the  case  of  eojeols  contaning  VCP,  the 
conversion rates to VERB and ADJ was highest. 
Most eojeols starting with VX were converted to 
AUX. 

4  Dependency annotation  
4.1  Head final  
Unlike  English,  Korean  language  is  a  head-final 
language 
in  which  complement  comes  first 
followed by  a  head  of verb phrase.  This  head is 
marked  as root  in  the  tag  system  of  Universal 
Dependency Relations. This root is the core of 
dependency 
sentence 
components are subordinated to this label. There 
are  two  kinds  of  Korean  sentences;  simple 
sentences  and  compound-complex.  Compound-
complex sentences can be divided into compound 
sentences  that  contain  two  consecutive  simple 
sentences,  and  complex  sentences  that  contain 
clauses with various kinds of sentence functions. It 
is easy to set up the root for a simple sentence, as 
there is only one predicate in the sentence.  

annotation 

as  other 

However, it is difficult to determine the head of 
the sentence in compound-complex sentences. In 
the case of complex sentences, the last predicate is 
likely to be the head, but in the case of compound 
sentences, it is hard to assign a head as the ranks of 
two  predicates  within  the  sentence  are  equal. 
Accordingly, we would like to apply the head-final 
principle  to  compound  sentences  based  on  the 
cases of simple sentence and complex sentences.  
In the Japanese language, there is a tendency of 
setting  up  the  right-most  predicate  stem  in  a 
sentence as the root while examining GSD, PUD, 
Modern, BCCWJ,  and KTC corpora  revealed by 
UD.  In  Korean,  based  on  this  criterion,  it  is 
necessary to set up the right-most eojeol containing 
a  predicate  as  the  root.  This  can  be  used  to 
minimize confusion in the Korean language, which 
has a complex sentence structure.  

Korean  predicates  play  various  role  by  being 
combined with endings; therefore, it is essential to 
first  check  whether  the  eojeol  actually  plays  the 
role  of  predicate,  upon  setting  up  a  predicate 
located in places other than the sentence final as 

the root. The error rate can increase if this process 
is  omitted.  The  error  rate  can  increase  if  this 
process  is  omitted.  Therefore,  following  the 
principle of head final will reduce analysis errors 
and increase the efficiency of the processing.

4.2  Verb sequence separated by white space 
If  two  or  more  consecutive  eojeols  take  on  the 
same  role  of  predicate  within  a  sentence,  the 
relationship  between  these  eojeols  should  be 
revealed.  Predicate  eojeols  are  combined  in  the 
following  cases:  combination  of  main  predicate 
with auxiliary predicate; and combination of two 
main predicate and main predicate.  
In the first case, root is assigned to the main 
predicate  and  aux  is  assigned  to  the  auxiliary 
predicate.  In  the  existing  dependency  syntactic 
parsing  or  structure  analysis,  if  the  head  final  is 

114provided, head position is allotted to the auxiliary 
predicate; however, following the UD system, aux 
position is given to the auxiliary predicate and the 
head position is not. This shows that the auxiliary 
predicate  does  not  describe  actual  contents  of  a 
sentence,  but  takes  on  an  auxiliary  function. 
Through  this  processing,  we  can  resolve  the 
controversy  over  whether  to  accept  the  Korean 
language  should  be  accepted  as  a  head  final 
language.  
In  the  case  of  a  combination  of  two  main 
predicates,  the  relationship  is  determined  by  the 
ending  of  the  preceding  main  predicate.  The 
following  main  predicate  is  labeled  as  root. 
However,  if  the  preceding  main  predicate  is 
combined  with  a  connective  ending,  it  can  be 
assigned as flat; if the preceding main predicate 
is  combined  with  an  adverbial  ending,  it  can  be 
designated as advcl or advmod, depending on 
the  combination  relationship  of  the  preceding 
Eojeol. Based on the KNC tagset, the connective 
ending is tagged by EC, and if the morpheme is “-
게,” it can be considered as an adverbial ending. In 
the case of an adnominal ending, there is an extra 
label of ETM in the KNC tagset.

5  Conclusion and Future works 
This paper aimed to suggest a plan for improving 
UD  Tagging  by  focusing  on  the  predicate.  A 
Korean  eojeol  consists  of  nouns  and  verbs 
combined  with  propositions  and  endings  that 
function as inflectional and derivational particles. 
The function of the stem of predicate depends on 
which  ending  is  combined  with  the  eojeol. 
Therefore,  we  proposed  modified UPOS tagging 
and dependency annotation to reflect the syntactic 
characteristics  of  the  Korean  language  using 
language-specific XPOS.  

This paper developed the discussion by focusing 
only  on  predicates-related  contents.  eojeols  with 
other  functions  that  were  not  considered  in  this 
paper will be examined in future studies.
