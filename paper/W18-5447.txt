Abstract

Neural dependency parsing models that com-
pose word representations from characters can
presumably exploit morphosyntax when mak-
ing attachment decisions. How much do they
know about morphology? We investigate how
well they handle morphological case, which
is important for parsing. Our experiments
on Czech, German and Russian suggest that
adding explicit morphological case—either or-
acle or predicted—improves neural depen-
dency parsing, indicating that the learned rep-
resentations in these models do not fully en-
code the morphological knowledge that they
need, and can still beneﬁt from targeted forms
of explicit linguistic modeling.
Introduction

1
Parsing morphologically rich languages (MRLs) is
difﬁcult due to the complex relationship of syn-
tax to morphology. But the success of neural net-
works offer an appealing solution to this problem
by computing word representation from charac-
ters. Character-level models (Ling et al., 2015;
Kim et al., 2016) learn relationship between sim-
ilar word forms and have shown to be effective
for parsing MRLs (Ballesteros et al., 2015; Dozat
et al., 2017; Shi et al., 2017; Bj¨orkelund et al.,
2017). Does that mean that we can do away with
explicit modeling of morphology altogether? Con-
sider two challenges in parsing MRLs raised by
Tsarfaty et al. (2010, 2013):
• Can we represent words abstractly so as to
reﬂect shared morphological aspects between
them?
• Which types of morphological information

should we include in the parsing model?

It is tempting to hypothesize that character-level
models effectively solve the ﬁrst problem. For
the second, Tsarfaty et al. (2010) and Seeker and
Kuhn (2013) reported that morphological case is

beneﬁcial across morphologically rich languages
with extensive case systems, where case syn-
cretism is pervasive and often hurts parsing perfor-
mance. But these studies focus on vintage parsers;
do neural parsers with character-level representa-
tions also solve this second problem?

We attempt to answer this question by asking
whether an explicit model of morphological case
helps dependency parsing, and our results show
that it does. Furthermore, a pipeline model in
which we feed predicted case to the parser out-
performs multi-task learning in which case predic-
tion is an auxiliary task. These results suggest that
neural dependency parsers do not adequately in-
fer this crucial linguistic feature directly from the
input text.

2 Dependency Parsing Model

We use a neural graph-based dependency parser
similar to that of Kiperwasser and Goldberg
(2016) and Zhang et al. (2017) for all our exper-
iments. We treat our parser as a black box and ex-
periment only with the input representations of the
parser. Let w = w1, . . . , w|w| be an input sentence
of length |w| and let w0 denote an artiﬁcial ROOT
token. For each input token wi, we compute the
context-independent representation, e(wi) with a
bidirectional LSTM (bi-LSTM) over characters.
We concatenate the result with its part-of-speech
(POS) representation, ti: xi = [e(wi); ti]. We then
feed xi to a word-level bi-LSTM encoder to learn
a contextual word representation wi. The model
uses these representations to compute the proba-
bility p(hi, (cid:96)i | w, i) of head hi ∈ {0, ...,|w|}/i
and label (cid:96)i of word wi.

sian; and we consider four forms of input (e(wi),
§2): word (embedding), characters, characters
with gold case, and characters with predicted
case. For the latter two, we append the case la-
bel to the character sequence, e.g. (cid:104)b, a, t,
Acc(cid:105) represents bat with accusative case. Us-
ing the same method, we also supply the gold
full analysis, to tease out the importance of case
speciﬁcally. Finally, we experiment with multi-
task learning (MTL; Søgaard and Goldberg, 2016;
Coavoux and Crabb´e, 2017), using the bi-LSTM
states of the lower layer of the bi-LSTM encoder
to predict case feature. Table 1 summarizes the
results.

Effect of case We found that the oracle condi-
tion of adding gold case improves the parsing per-
formance for all languages, and indeed explains
all of the gains of a full morphological analysis.
In German, case syncretism is pervasive—a sin-
gle surface form can represent multiple cases—
and we see improvement of up to 2.4 LAS points
on test set. This results suggest that the character-
level models still struggle to disambiguate case
when they learn only from the input text.

%case shows percentage of training tokens anno-
tated with case.

We then look at the performance when we re-
place gold case with predicted case. We train a
morphological tagger to predict case information.
The tagger has the same structure as the parser’s
encoder, with an additional feedforward neural
network with one hidden layer followed by a soft-
max layer. We found that predicted case improves
accuracy, although the effect is different across
languages. These results are interesting, since in
vintage parsers, predicted case usually harmed ac-
curacy (Tsarfaty et al., 2010). However, we note
that our taggers use gold POS, which might help.
Pipeline model vs. Multi-task learning In gen-
eral, MTL models achieve similar or slightly better
performance than the character-only models, sug-
gesting that supplying case in this way is beneﬁ-
cial. However, we found that using predicted case
in a pipeline model gives more improvements than
MTL. We also observe an interesting pattern in
which MTL achieves better tagging accuracy than
the pipeline model but lower performance in pars-
ing (Table 2). This is surprising since it suggests
that the MTL model must learn to effectively en-
code case in the model’s representation, but must
not effectively use it for parsing.

4 Conclusion
Vintage dependency parsers rely on hand-crafted
feature engineering to encode morphology. The
recent success of character-level models for many
NLP tasks motivates us to ask whether their
learned representations are powerful enough to
completely replace this feature engineering. By
empirically testing this using a single feature
known to be important—morphological case—we
have shown that they are not. Experiments with
multi-task learning suggest that although MTL
gives better performance, it is still underperformed
by a traditional pipeline model.
