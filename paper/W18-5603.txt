Abstract

Recently, segment convolutional neural net-
works have been proposed for end-to-end rela-
tion extraction in the clinical domain, achiev-
ing results comparable to or outperforming the
approaches with heavy manual feature engi-
neering. In this paper, we analyze the errors
made by the neural classiﬁer based on confu-
sion matrices, and then investigate three sim-
ple extensions to overcome its limitations. We
ﬁnd that including ontological association be-
tween drugs and problems, and data-induced
association between medical concepts does
not reliably improve the performance, but that
large gains are obtained by the incorporation
of semantic classes to capture relation triggers.

Introduction

The extraction of relations from clinical notes is
a fundamental clinical NLP task, crucial to sup-
port automated health care systems and to enable
secondary use of clinical notes for research (Wang
et al., 2017). In clinical relation extraction, the
2010 i2b2/VA challenge dataset has been by far the
most widely used. Three categories of relations are
annotated in discharge summaries: those between
medical treatments and problems (TrP)1, between
tests and problems (TeP)2 and between pairs of
problems (PP)3 (Uzuner et al., 2011). Many sys-
tems participating in the shared task used carefully
crafted syntactic and semantic features, sometimes
in combination with rules (Grouin et al., 2010; Rink
et al., 2011). Recently, neural network approaches
have been applied to this task, where they serve as
feature extractors, with a softmax layer for classiﬁ-
cation. In this case, human-engineered or external
features are usually not included. Two examples

1Tr[A|C|I|NA|W]P: treatment {administered for, causes,
improves, not administered because of, worsens} a problem.

2Te[C|R]P: test {conducted for, revealed} a problem.
3PIP: problem indicates a medical problem.

on which we base our work are Sahu et al. (2016)
and Luo et al. (2017), who achieve results sim-
ilar to or better than the best-scoring approaches
participating in the i2b2 challenge. They use convo-
lutional neural networks, in which a convolutional
unit processes a piece of text segment (SegCNN) in
a sliding window manner, and then applies a max-
pooling operation to provide the hidden features.
In Sahu et al. (2016), the unit of text is simply a
sentence, and the CNN constructs a global repre-
sentation. On the other hand, Luo et al. (2017)
argue that since multiple relations can occur in a
single sentence, one representation is not sufﬁcient.
Therefore, they break the sentence into segments,
so the encoding and the pooling operations apply
to one segment at a time. Each sentence consists of
ﬁve segments: tokens preceding the ﬁrst concept
c1; c1 itself; tokens between c1 and c2; concept c2;
and the tokens following it. This idea is related to
dynamic pooling, known from previous event ex-
traction work on the ACE 2005 dataset (Chen et al.,
2015). More generally, the extension of neural
networks with background information have been
studied, inter alia, for text categorization, natural
language inference, and entity and event extraction
(K. M. et al., 2018; Yang and Mitchell, 2017).

In our work, we aim to boost the performance of
a SegCNN classiﬁer by ﬁrst identifying its weak-
est points in a confusion matrix analysis, and then
addressing these with external linguistic and do-
main features. We observe as much as a 6 point
improvement in % F1 by a simple addition of se-
mantic classes; a modest improvement with PMI
features for PP relations; and no effect when adding
association information between drugs and prob-
lems. We make the code, which is a modiﬁcation of
Luo et al. (2017)’s implementation of segment con-
volutional neural networks, available at https:

sents the number of correctly classiﬁed relations, and
is shown in bold. The colored cells highlight low sensi-
tivity (blue), hallucinating relations (green) and confus-
able relations (orange).

2 Analysis of limitations

To better understand the limitations of a SegCNN
extractor, we analyze its results with confusion ma-
trices. In Table 1, we use color coding to point
to three types of challenges: a) poor sensitivity
(blue cells), which are errors due to the classiﬁer’s
conservativeness in proclaiming a relation; b) “hal-
lucinating” relations (green), which are precision
errors where relations should not be identiﬁed; and
c) confusable relations (orange), where we see
that the TrCP relation is often classiﬁed as TrAP
(27/69 times), and similarly for the other treatment-
problem relations. This is especially true for the
less frequent relations TrNAP and TrWP, where the
correct predictions are outnumbered by the cases
wrongly predicted as TrAP. The TrAP predictions
by the system account for the most mistakes. We
can see from the number of a) and b) errors on
the TrP relations—76% of all mistakes made by
the model—that identifying the presence of a rela-
tion is more challenging than type classiﬁcation of
relations, cf. Rink et al. (2011). Similar observa-
tions can be made about the test-problem relations.
For example, TeCP is frequently confused with

TeRP (36), and the TeRP type is often hallucinated
(294). Overall, determining the presence of a rela-
tion is more difﬁcult than discriminating between
TeCP and TeRP as 91% of mistakes are only due
to detection. This number is higher here than for
TrP relations since we are dealing with a smaller
number of relation types, which causes less con-
fusion in class assignment. For problem-problem
relations, the matrix shows the model is somewhat
more likely to predict the relation spuriously than
to miss the relation.

In a qualitative analysis, we ﬁnd that relations
are often unrecognized in sentences with several
(coordinated) concepts:

(1)

she also had climbing bilirubin [. . . ] and
was started on zosyntr for suspected biliary
obstruction and ascending cholangitispr
coverage . (gold: TrAP)

Relations can be hallucinated especially when two
concepts may seem to be associated, but the knowl-
edge of syntax or the domain tells us they are not:

(2)

the patient was treated with tylenol orallytr
as well as ativan for anxietypr that she had
about going home (gold: none)

Here, medical knowledge of compatibility between
drugs and problems could help, e.g. that tylenol
is not indicated for anxiety, but ativan is. In the
following example, the classiﬁer wrongly predicts
TeCP, although there is a clear cue for the correct
relation TeRP in the predicate (“found”):

(3)

during initial evaluationte for a coronary
artery bypass graft , 80% to 90% of the
right coronary artery stenosispr was found

3 Addressing the limitations

To deal with poor sensitivity and hallucinated re-
lations mentioned above, we introduce simple do-
main knowledge in the form of association between
a pair of concepts. We collect the association infor-
mation either from an ontology (§ 3.1) or induce it
from the data (§ 3.2). To increase the discrimina-
tory power of the extractor to differentiate between
the relations, we incorporate a semantic class fea-
ture which could give the classiﬁer an explicit cue
about the presence of a relation (§ 3.3).

3.1 Drug-problem association (Drugbank)

We use Drugbank (Wishart et al., 2017) to obtain a
compatibility score between a drug treatment and
a problem. We create a mapping from all drug
names, synonyms and product names, to their indi-
cations. We also extract a mapping between drugs
and their adverse reactions. In this way, we obtain
71,683 drug names, 3108 indications and 1163 ad-
verse reactions. If there is a match for an observed
treatment-problem pair in the drug-indication map-
ping, we simply assign a value of 1 (and scale it, as
explained in Appendix) and -1 otherwise. Consider
the example where we consider creating a relation
between neurontintr and seizure historypr. In the
indication for neurontin from Drugbank, seizures
are mentioned as a possible medical problem, so
this type of information could serve as background
evidence for the classiﬁer. The adverse drug ef-
fects represent a separate feature and are included
in the same way. Due to low coverage of the drug-
problem features for the treatment-problem concept
pairs in the data (416 pairs are found, out of 7699),
we also investigate a more general, data-induced
approach, described next.

3.2 Concept-concept association (PMI)

We obtain association scores for concept pairs in
all relation types by estimating a pointwise mutual
information (PMI) model on a large corpus. We
use the MIMIC-III corpus (Johnson et al., 2016) to
compute the PMI for the co-occurring concepts.
We ﬁrst recognize clinical concepts in MIMIC-
III using CLAMP (Soysal et al., 2017), and use
Ucto (Van Gompel et al., 2012) for preprocess-
ing. We then collect the counts, where two con-
cepts are taken as co-occurring if they are men-
tioned in the same sentence, irrespective of the
ordering. If found, we remove any determiners

and pronouns. The concept type identiﬁed by
CLAMP is appended to its mention. For a con-
cept pair in our data, we perform a type-sensitive
and order-insensitive lookup. In case of no match,
we back-off by gradually removing up to two left-
most tokens. We ﬁnd that the coverage lies be-
tween 68–82% depending on the relation category
and the dataset split, and that the highest coverage
applies for PP relations. The concept-concept as-
sociation for relation extraction has been studied
previously by Demner-Fushman et al. (2010) and
de Bruijn et al. (2011), who used Medline R(cid:13) as the
resource, whereas we achieved better results and
coverage on the development set with MIMIC-III
than Medline R(cid:13).

3.3 Semantic classes

The semantic classes can provide cues about the
relation types present in the sentence and facilitate
distinguishing between different TrP and TeP rela-
tions4. We obtain the classes with WordNet (Miller,
1995) and an online thesaurus5. This was a man-
ual process, in which we looked up the synonyms
for all relation type names. For the seven TrP and
TeP relation types, a hundred lexical triggers were
obtained in total. For example, {show, reveal, dis-
play. . . } belong to the “revealing” class indicative
of the TeRP relation. Lexical triggers are matched
to their semantic classes if they occur in the non-
concept sentence segments. We ﬁnd that for TrP
relations, matching only with the middle segment
works best, but for TeP, the preceding, middle and
succeeding segments work best.

4We do not use semantic classes for PP since there is only

one relation type, PIP.

4 Results

In our experiments, we use different data splits
from those used in Luo et al. (2017) to increase

the size of the training part and to also create a
development set. The details, including the experi-
mental setting, can be found in the Appendix. For
the results using the vanilla SegCNN, we retrain
the original models by Luo et al. (2017) and report
their performance on our data splits. This gives
us the results which are a few points lower on TrP
and TeP relations, but also few points higher on PP
relations, than the results reported in their paper.

We show the results in Figure 1, where % F1
is reported for different relation categories. Over-
all, the highest scores are achieved on TeP rela-
tions. The addition of semantic classes helps the
most, with an improvement of almost 7 points over
SegCNN for TrP, and 6 points for TeP relations. We
think the advantage comes from the fact that the
relation triggers are represented explicitly as the in-
put to the classiﬁer, whereas in the case of the base
SegCNN, the classiﬁer can only rely on a dense
vectorial representation, which captures the trigger
words more fuzzily. The contribution of the associa-
tion features is less pronounced. The drug-problem
(SemClass) and concept-concept (PMI) features
have a small positive effect for TrP relations, with
PMI working best (+0.5) for PP relations, where
the coverage is the highest.

We now have a detailed look at the effect of
the individual features. For this, we contrast the
confusion matrix obtained from the base SegCNN
with the confusion matrix of an extended model,
where these matrices represent counts averaged
over 20 runs. We obtain a new, contrasted matrix
by subtracting the SegCNN matrix from that of the
extended model, and display it as a heat map. An
extension works well when the counts in the ﬁrst di-
agonal are positive, and all the remaining counts are
negative. In Figures 2a and 2b, we see an increase
in correct classiﬁcations for semantic class features
across all relation types, which speaks about the
generality of this feature. The sensitivity for all
relations has also increased (ﬁrst column) as there
are fewer true relations that remained unidentiﬁed.
However, the counts of the less frequent relations
(TrIP, TrNAP and TrWP) have shifted to incorrect
relations (note the pale-red cells in the lower left
corner of 2a). The improvements are the most ob-
vious for the most frequent relations (TrAP and
TeRP), with a clear increase in sensitivity, and a re-
duction in the number of unrelated (None) concepts
classiﬁed as either TrAP or TeRP. The confusion
matrix comparison for the problem-problem asso-

25ciation (PMI) feature is shown in Figures 2c and
2d.6 For TeP relations, we see that the addition of
this feature type helps in reducing the number of
hallucinated relations (ﬁrst row), but at the expense
of sensitivity—note that several relations are left
unidentiﬁed (the counts in the TeCP and TeRP in
the ﬁrst column increased). A slight positive effect
of PMI features can be seen for the PP relation,
where the model becomes less prone to proclaim
unrelated concepts as related (ﬁrst row). Based on
these ﬁgures, we can conclude that the PMI feature
helps in deciding whether a pair of concepts should
be linked with a relation or not, but does not have
sufﬁcient power to distinguish between different
relations.

In conclusion, results show that the SegCNN
model often misses, hallucinates or confuses rela-
tions, and that including semantic classes for rela-
tion triggers helps for different relation types.

Embeddings We trained the word embeddings
on a combination of PubMed abstracts, open-
access PMC articles (Hakala et al., 2016) and
MIMIC-III intensive care notes (Johnson et al.,
2016), all segmented and tokenized,
totaling
around 9 billion tokens. We induce the embed-
dings using word2vec’s CBOW model (Mikolov
et al., 2013) and the default parameters, except for
dimensionality, which we set to 200 for TrP rela-
tions, 500 for TeP and 400 for PP relations, as in
Luo et al. (2017).

A Supplemental Material

A.1 Experimental setup

Luo et al. (2017) used a part of the i2b2/VA dataset
that is no longer available to those requesting the
dataset. We therefore only have 170 documents for
training and 256 documents for testing. Since our
goal is to build an accurate relation extractor, we
re-balance the dataset by increasing the size of the
training corpus, reducing the size of the test set and
creating a small development set. The sizes of the
ﬁnal splits are shown in Table 2. In all our exper-
iments, we use the gold-standard concept annota-
tions, and train one classiﬁer per relation category.

Hyper-parameters We use the same set of
hyper-parameters as Luo et al. (2017), except that
we turn off the drop out on the ﬁnal layer of the
classiﬁer network, which harmed the performance
in our experiments on the development set. We also
noticed that scaling of the added features positively
affected the results, so we tuned the scaling factor
as well.
