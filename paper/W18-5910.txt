Abstract

This paper describes the system that team
UChicagoCompLx developed for the 2018
Social Media Mining for Health Applications
(SMM4H) Shared Task. We use a variant of
the Message-level Sentiment Analysis (MSA)
model of (Baziotis et al., 2017), a word-
level stacked bidirectional Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) network equipped with at-
tention, to classify medication-related tweets
in the four subtasks of the SMM4H Shared
Task. Without any subtask-speciﬁc tuning, the
model is able to achieve competitive results
across all subtasks. We make the datasets,
model weights, and code publicly available1.

Introduction

The Shared Task of the 2018 Social Media Min-
ing for Health Applications (SMM4H) workshop
(Weissenbacher et al., 2018) proposed four sub-
tasks in the domain of social media mining for
health monitoring and surveillance. From a Nat-
ural Language Processing (NLP) viewpoint, these
tasks present a considerable challenge since the
nature of social media posts requires dealing with
both a signiﬁcant level of language variation and
a widespread presence of noise (spelling mistakes,
syntactic errors etc). Any classiﬁer designed for
this textual domain should take into account the
above intricacies and should, furthermore, be able
to deal with with semantic complexities in the var-
ious ways people express medication-related con-
cepts and outcomes.

To address these challenges, we use a variant
of the Message-level Sentiment Analysis (MSA)
model of (Baziotis et al., 2017), originally de-
veloped for sentiment analysis of Twitter posts,
to classify tweets in all four subtasks.
The

model is a word-level stacked bidirectional LSTM
(BiLSTM) with context-aware attention that uses
word-embeddings pretrained by (Baziotis et al.,
2017) on a corpus of ≈ 330M tweets. Without ad-
ditional hyperparameter tuning or subtask-speciﬁc
modiﬁcations, the model outperforms the average
of all submitted systems in subtasks 1 and 4 and
achieves ﬁrst place (by a F1-score margin of 0.234
from the next team) in subtask 2. In subtask 3 our
model was placed 6th out of 9 systems.

In the following sections, we introduce the
datasets, discuss preprocessing steps we took,
present the model and its training setup, report re-
sults, and conclude with potential avenues for fu-
ture research.

2 Datasets

In this section, we describe the datasets of each
subtask. Subtasks 1, 3 and 4 are binary classiﬁ-
cation problems while subtask 2 is a three-class
classiﬁcation problem. The data was manually an-
notated by the organizers.

Subtask 1 is about

the automatic detection
of posts mentioning the name of a drug or di-
etary supplement, as deﬁned by the United States
Food and Drug Administration (FDA). A tweet
is assigned label 1 if it contains the name of
one or more drugs or supplements and 0 other-
wise. Subtask 2 poses the challenge of auto-
matic classiﬁcation of posts describing medica-
tion intake. A tweet is assigned label 1 if “the
user clearly expresses a personal medication in-
take/consumption”, 2 if the tweet suggests (with-
out certainty) that “the user may have taken the
medication”, and 3 if the tweet mentions medi-
cation names but does not indicate personal in-
take. Subtask 3 concerns the automatic classiﬁ-
cation of posts mentioning an adverse drug reac-
tion (ADR). A tweet is assigned label 1 if it men-

tions an ADR and 0 otherwise. Finally, Subtask
4 deals with the automatic detection of posts men-
tioning vaccination behavior related to inﬂuenza
vaccines. The annotators were asked the ques-
tion “Does this message indicate that someone re-
ceived, or intended to receive, a ﬂu vaccine?” and
a tweet was assigned label 1 if the answer was af-
ﬁrmative and 0 otherwise. Subtasks 1, 3 and 4 are
evaluated using the F1-score for the positive class
while subtask 2 uses the micro-averaged F1-score
for classes 1 and 2. Subtask 1 is additionally eval-
uated on precision and recall for the positive class.
Due to Twitter privacy policies, the training set
for any subtask did not contain the actual tweet
text. To obtain said text, participants were pro-
vided with the tweet ID of each dataset example
along with a script to use for downloading the text
using this ID. The process inevitably resulted in
fewer tweets than the number of IDs contained in
the original dataset, primarily because a number
of tweets had been removed (either by the users
themselves, or by Twitter because e.g.
the user
deleted his account) while others failed to down-
load (due to e.g.
lag issues when requesting the
HTML of the tweet). To avoid such issues in the
evaluation datasets, the organizers decided to pro-
vide the tweet text along with the ID. Table [1]
provides a short summary of the number of tweets
that were available to our team for each subtask.

3 Pre-processing

We applied identical preprocessing to all datasets.
We replaced Twitter speciﬁc strings with appro-
priate tokens (e.g.
emojis were replaced by
$EMOJI$, numbers were replaced by $NUM-
BER$, website urls by $URL$ etc) to reduce the
vocabulary size and to ameliorate the noisy nature
of the text. All non-alphanumeric characters and
all tokens that were too short (fewer than 2 char-
acters) or too long (more than 15 characters) were
removed. Finally, all text was converted to lower
case and any excess whitespace (i.e. newlines and
tabs) was removed.

4 Model description
4.1 Model architecture
We use a variant of the Message-level Sentiment
Analysis (MSA) model of (Baziotis et al., 2017).
The model consists of two stacked BiLSTMs with
a context-attention mechanism `a la (Yang et al.,
2016) that identiﬁes the maximally informative
words for each label. We describe subsequently
the individual network layers.

The input is a tweet, regarded as a sequence
of words, which is projected to a vector space
of ﬁxed size via the Embedding Layer. The
weights of the embedding layer are initialized us-
ing pre-trained word embeddings that (Baziotis
et al., 2017) trained on a Twitter corpus of approx-
imately ≈ 330M tweets. We opt for these embed-
dings instead of the standard Word2Vec (Mikolov
et al., 2013a,b) ones since they have been trained
on a similar textual domain to the tasks at hand.

A LSTM Layer placed on top of the embed-
ding layer takes as input the embedding weights
and produces a representation {hi}T
i=1 where, hi
is the hidden state of the LSTM at time-step i, in-
tuitively corresponding to a summary of all the in-
formation of the sentence (viewed as a sequence
{wi}T
i=1 of words) up to wi. This constitutes a
forward LSTM. Since we are using a bidirectional
LSTM, we also have an LSTM that scans the se-
quence of words in the reverse direction. The ﬁnal
representation of a word is produced by concate-
nating the representations from the forward and
backward LSTM:

−→
hi||←−

hi

hi =

(1)
where || denotes the concatenation operator. We
opt for a stacked BiLSTM, and consequently we
place an additional BiLSTM layer on top of the
preceding layer. The motivation for this choice
comes from the literature on the interpretation
of hidden states of Recurrent Neural Networks
(RNNs) (Belinkov et al., 2017; Belinkov, 2018) in
which it has been claimed that deeper layers are
able to learn more abstract semantic representa-
tions of sentences, thus achieving superior perfor-
mance in downstream tasks.

To account for the fact that not all words con-
tribute equally to the assignment of a label, we
place an Attention Layer on top of the BiL-
STMs following work like (Sutskever et al., 2014)
who successfully used attention mechanisms for

39sequence-to-sequence neural machine translation.
We use context-attention, following (Yang et al.,
2016). A context vector uh is initialized and is
governed by the following update equations:

as wi = max( #»x )/xi for any class i. Finally,
early-stopping (Caruana et al., 2001) is employed
to terminate training after the validation loss has
stopped decreasing.

ei = tanh(Whhi + bh)

(4)

i=1

where Wh, bh and uh are learned parameters, hi
is the concatenation of the representations of the
forward and backward LSTM, introduced in equa-
tion (1), and L is the number of cells in one LSTM
layer.

Finally, we feed the representation r produced
by the attention layer to a Dense Layer with sig-
moid activation (softmax for subtask 2) and obtain
a probability distribution over the classes. If the
probability assigned to a tweet is greater than 0.5
we assign label 1, otherwise we assign 0.

4.2 Training setup
We train the model
to minimize the negative
log-likelihood loss using back-propagation with
stochastic gradient descent and mini-batch size of
50. We use the Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba,
2015) with gradient norm clipping (Pascanu et al.,
2013) at 1. For subtasks 1, 2 and 3 we use a
90 − 10 train-validation split, while for subtask 4
we use 10−fold stratiﬁed cross-validation in con-
sideration of the very small test set. Table [1] sum-
marizes the information on train-validation splits.

4.3 Regularization
To make the model more robust to over-ﬁtting, we
employ, following (Baziotis et al., 2017), a num-
ber of regularization techniques. We add Gaus-
sian noise at the embedding layer and use dropout
(Srivastava et al., 2014) to ignore the signal from
a set of randomly selected neurons in the net-
work. Dropout is also applied after each LSTM
layer as well as to the recurrent connections of
the LSTM (Gal and Ghahramani, 2016). L2 reg-
ularization along with class weights are applied to
the loss function to prevent overly large weights
and to account for class imbalance. Class weights
are computed as follows: assuming that #»x is the
vector of class counts, the weights are deﬁned

4.4 Hyperparameter tuning
We use the similar hyperparameters to (Baziotis
et al., 2017). In particular, we use 150 as the size
of the LSTM hidden states (300 in total since we
are using a BiLSTM), the Gaussian noise param-
eter is set to σ = 0.3, dropout rate on top of the
embedding layer is set to 0.3 and dropout rate on
top of the LSTM layers is set to 0.5. Dropout at the
recurrent connections is also set to 0.3. L2 regu-
larization at the loss function is set to 0.0001. Fi-
nally, we initialize the learning rate at 0.001. De-
parting from (Baziotis et al., 2017), we use word
embeddings of dimension 100. Vocabulary size
and maximum sequence length are set to 7000 and
50 respectively for all subtasks and the patience
level for early-stopping is set to 0.001 in 5 epochs.

5 Experiments and results
5.1 Experimental setup
The model was developed using Keras2 with the
Tensorﬂow (Abadi et al., 2016) backend. For data
preparation and processing we use Scikit-learn
(Pedregosa et al., 2011). Given the small size of
the datasets, we do not use GPUs for training the
model. A standard 8-core CPU is sufﬁcient. Fi-
nally, for designing the network architecture, we
use part of the code released by (Baziotis et al.,
2017)3.

5.2 Results
For subtasks 1 and 4,
the organizers chose to
disclose to each team only their respective score
along with the average score of all submitted sys-
tems. These results are summarized in Table [2].
Our system performed better than the average in
both subtasks, considerably so in subtask 1.

For subtasks 2 and 3, the organizers released the
complete leaderboards, presented in Tables [3] and
[4] respectively. Our system greatly outperformed
all other systems by a signiﬁcant margin in subtask
2. In subtask 3, our system ranked 6th (out of 9
participants), potentially because the other teams
developed specialized systems for the particular

6 Conclusion and future directions

We demonstrated that the variant of the MSA
model of (Baziotis et al., 2017) performs compet-
itively when applied to the domain of medication-
related short text classiﬁcation. Without hyperpa-
rameter tuning, major architectural modiﬁcations,
or task-speciﬁc adjustments, the model obtained
competitive results in subtasks 1 and 4 and ranked

ﬁrst in subtask 3, greatly outperforming all other
models in terms of precision, recall and F1-score.
The model’s performance in this Shared Task is
further testament to the ability of attentive RNNs
to perform at state-of-the-art level in short text
classiﬁcation where individual word-meaning is
essential.

In the future, we aim to investigate whether
ensembles of word- and character-level attentive
RNNs can perform even better. The beneﬁts of en-
sembling for text classiﬁcation can be seen in nu-
merous NLP tasks ranging from Natural Language
Inference (Gong et al., 2018, among many others)
to product categorization (Skinner, 2018). Word-
level models perform well in capturing aspects
of the semantics (Belinkov et al., 2017) while
character-level models succeed in capturing syn-
tactic information about the text. Ensembles of
these diverse types of models can potentially lead
to improved performance.

A second avenue to pursue would be multi-task
learning, an area of active research that has shown
promising results in text classiﬁcation (Liu et al.,
2016, 2017, among others). Given that all subtasks
are nearly identical in nature (all but one of them
being binary classiﬁcation problems) and share a
highly overlapping lexicon, they provide an ex-
cellent ground for testing the merits of multi-task
learning.
