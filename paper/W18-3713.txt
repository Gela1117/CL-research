Abstract

In this paper we present a qualitatively en-
hanced deep convolution recurrent neural
network for computing the quality of a text
in an automatic essay scoring task. The
novelty of the work lies in the fact that
instead of considering only the word and
sentence representation of a text, we try to
augment the different complex linguistic,
cognitive and psychological features asso-
ciated within a text document along with
a hierarchical convolution recurrent neu-
ral network framework. Our preliminary
investigation shows that incorporation of
such qualitative feature vectors along with
standard word/sentence embeddings can
give us better understanding about im-
proving the overall evaluation of the input
essays.

Introduction

The quality of text depends upon a number of lin-
guistic factors, corresponding to different textual
properties, such as grammar, vocabulary, style,
topic relevance, clarity, comprehensibility, infor-
mativeness, lexical diversity, discourse coherence,
and cohesion (Crossley et al., 2008)(McNamara
et al., 2002).
In addition, there are deep cogni-
tive and psychological features, such as types of
syntactic constructions, grammatical relations and
measures of sentence complexity, that make auto-
matic analysis of text quality a non-trivial task.

Developing tools for automatic text quality
to
analysis have become extremely important
organizations that need to assess writing skills
among adults and students on a regular basis. Be-
cause of the high participation in such assess-
ments, the amount of time and effort required to
grade the large volume of textual data generated
is too high to be feasible by a human evaluator.

Manual evaluation processes by multiple evalua-
tors may also be prone to erroneous judgments
due to mutual disagreements between the eval-
uators. Therefore, developing a means through
which such essays can be automatically scored,
with minimum human interference, seem to be the
best way forward to meet the growing demands of
the education world, while keeping inter-evaluator
disagreements to a minimum. Automatic Essay
Scoring (AES) systems have thus been in the re-
search focus of multiple organizations to counter
the above issues (Landauer, 2003).

A typical AES system takes as input an essay
written on a speciﬁc topic. The system then as-
signs a numeric score to the essay reﬂecting its
quality, based on its content, grammar, organiza-
tion and other factors discussed above.

A plethora of research have been done to
develop AES systems on various
languages
(Taghipour and Ng, 2016; Dong et al., 2017;
Alikaniotis et al., 2016; Attali and Burstein, 2004;
Chen and He, 2013; Chen et al., 2010; Cummins
et al., 2016). Most of these tools are based on re-
gression methods applied to a set of carefully de-
signed complex linguistic and cognitive features.
Knowledge of such complex features have been
shown to achieve performance that is indistin-
guishable from that of human examiners. How-
ever, since it is difﬁcult to exhaustively enumerate
all the multiple factors that inﬂuence the quality
of texts, the challenge of automatically assigning
a satisfactory score to an essay still remains.

Recent advancement

in deep learning tech-
niques have inﬂuenced researchers to apply them
for AES tasks. The deep multi-layer neural net-
works can automatically learn useful features from
data, with lower layers learning basic feature de-
tectors and upper levels learning more high-level
abstract features. Deep neural network models,
however, do not allow us to identify and extract
those properties of text that the network identi-

particular, deep network models fail to take into
account integral linguistic and cognitive factors
present in text, which play an important role in
an essay score assigned by experts. Such models
emphasizes a simple uniform paradigm for NLP:
”language is just sequences of words”. While this
approach has rapidly found enormous popular-
ity and success, its limitations are now becoming
more apparent. Gradually researchers stressing to-
wards the importance of linguistic structure and
the fact that it reduces the search space of possible
outputs, making it easier to generate well-formed
output (Lapata, 2017). Dyer (Dyer, 2017) also ar-
gued for the importance of incorporating linguistic
structure into deep learning. He drew attention to
the inductive biases inherent in the sequential ap-
proach, arguing that RNNs have an inductive bias
towards sequential recency, while syntax-guided
hierarchical architectures have an inductive bias
towards syntactic recency. Several papers noted
the apparent inability of RNNs to capture long-
range dependencies, and obtained improvements
using recursive models instead (Chen et al., 2017).

In order to overcome the aforementioned is-
sues, in this paper we propose a qualitatively en-
hanced deep convolution recurrent neural network
architecture for automatic scoring of essays. Our
model takes into account both the word-level and
sentence-level representations, as well as linguis-
tic and psychological feature embeddings. To the
best of our knowledge, no other prior work in this
ﬁeld has investigated the effectiveness of combin-
ing word and sentence embeddings with linguistic
features for AES tasks. Our preliminary investiga-
tion shows that incorporation of linguistic feature
vectors along with standard word/sentence embed-
dings do improve the overall scoring of the input
essays.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows:
Section 2 describes the recent state of art
in
AES systems. Our proposed Linguistically in-
formed Convolution LSTM model architecture is
discussed in Section 3, while section 4 has fur-
ther details on generation of linguistic feature vec-
tors. In section 5, we cover the experimentation
and evaluation technique, reporting the obtained
results in section 6, and ﬁnally concluding the pa-
per in section 7.

2 Related Works

A plethora of attempts have been taken to develop
AES systems over the years. A detailed overview
of the early works on AES is reported in (Valenti
et al., 2003). An Intelligent Essay Assessor (Foltz
et al., 1999) was proposed more recently that uses
Latent Semantic Analysis to compute the seman-
tic similarity between texts. Lonsdale and Strong-
Krause (Lonsdale and Strong-Krause, 2003) used
the Link Grammar parser (Sleator and Temperley,
1995) to score texts based on average sentence-
level scores calculated from the parser’s cost vec-
tor. In Rudner and Liang’s Bayesian Essay Test
Scoring System (Rudner and Liang, 2002), stylis-
tic features in a text are classiﬁed using a Naive
Bayes classiﬁer. Attali and Burstein’s e-Rater (At-
tali and Burstein, 2004), includes aspects of gram-
mar, vocabulary and style among other linguistic
features, whose weights are ﬁtted by regression.
A weakly supervised bag-of-word approach was
proposed by Chen et al. (Chen et al., 2010). A
discriminative learning based approach was pro-
posed by Yannakoudakis et al.
(Yannakoudakis
and Cummins, 2015) that extracts deep linguis-
tic features and employs a discriminative learning-
to-rank model that out-performs regression. Re-
cently, Farra et al.
(Farra et al., 2015) utilized
variants of logistic and linear regression and de-
veloped scoring models. McNamara et al.’s hier-
archical classiﬁcation approach (McNamara et al.,
2015) uses linguistic, semantic and rhetorical fea-
tures. Despite the existing body of work, at-
tempts to incorporate more diverse features to
text scoring models are ongoing. (Klebanov and
Flor, 2013) demonstrated improved performance
by adding information about levels of association
among word pairs in a given text. (Somasundaran
et al., 2014) used the interaction of lexical chains
with discourse elements for evaluating the qual-
ity of essays. Crossley et al.
(Crossley et al.,
2015) identiﬁed student attributes, such as stan-
dardized test scores, and used them in conjunc-
tion with textual features to develop essay scoring
models. Readability features (Zesch et al., 2015)
and text coherence have also been proposed as a
source of information to assess the ﬂow of infor-
mation and argumentation of an essay (Chen and
He, 2013). A detailed overview of the features
used in AES systems can be found in (Zesch et al.,
2015). Some attempts have been made to address
different aspects of essay writing, like argument

94strength and organization, independently, through
designing task-speciﬁc features for each aspect
(Persing et al., 2010; Persing and Ng, 2015). There
has been a lot of recent work in deep neural net-
work models based on continuous-space represen-
tation of the input and non-linear functions. Re-
cently, deep learning techniques have been ap-
plied to text analysis problems including AES sys-
tems (Alikaniotis et al., 2016; Dong and Zhang,
2016; Dong et al., 2017; Taghipour and Ng, 2016),
giving better results compared to statistical mod-
els with handcrafted features (Dong and Zhang,
2016). Both recurrent neural networks (Williams
and Zipser, 1989; Mikolov et al., 2010) and convo-
lution neural networks (LeCun et al., 1998; Kim,
2014) have been used to automatically score input
essays. In comparison to the work of Alikaniotis et
al. (Alikaniotis et al., 2016) and Taghipour and Ng
(Taghipour and Ng, 2016) that uses single-layer
LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) over
the word embeddings for essay scoring, and Dong
and Zhang (Dong and Zhang, 2016) used a two-
level hierarchical CNN structure to model sen-
tences and documents separately. More recently,
(Dong et al., 2017) et al. proposed a hierarchical
attention based CNN-LSTM model for automatic
essay scoring.

Although the deep learning based approaches
are reported to be performing better than the previ-
ous approaches, the performance may yet be bet-
tered by the use of the complex linguistic and
cognitive features that are important in modeling
such texts. Our proposed system, takes into ac-
count both word and sentence level embeddings,
as well as deep linguistic features available within
the given text document and together learns the
model. The detail architecture and working of the
model is depicted in the following sections.

3 The Qualitatively Enhanced

Convolution Recurrent Neural
Network

As mentioned earlier, neural network based mod-
els are capable of modeling complex patterns in
data and do not depend on manual engineering of
features, but they do not consider the latent lin-
guistic characteristics of a text. In this section, we
will present a deep neural network based model
that takes into account different complex linguis-
tic, cognitive and psychological features associ-
ated within a text document along with a hierar-

chical convolution network connected with a bidi-
rectional long-short term memory (LSTM) model
(Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) (Schmidhu-
ber et al., 2006). We will begin the model archi-
tecture by ﬁrst explaining about generating the lin-
guistic and psychological feature embeddings that
will in turn be used by the neural network archi-
tecture.

3.1 Generating Linguistic and Psychological

Feature Embeddings

We have used different linguistic and psycholog-
ical features available within a text to augment
them with the deep neural architecture.

The psychological features used in this work
are mostly derived from Linguistic Information
and Word Count (LIWC) tool (Tausczik and Pen-
nebaker, 2010). The rapid development of AI, In-
ternet technologies, social network, and elegant
new statistical strategies have helped usher in a
new age of the psychological study of language.
By drawing on massive amounts of text, it is in-
deed possible to link everyday language use with
behavioral and self-reported measures of personal-
ity, social behavior, and cognitive styles (Tausczik
and Pennebaker, 2010). LIWC is a text analysis
tool that counts words in psychologically mean-
ingful categories. Empirical results using LIWC
already demonstrated its ability to detect meaning
in a wide variety of experimental settings, such as
to show attentional focus, emotionality, social re-
lationships, thinking styles, and individual differ-
ences.

linguistically informed are:

Dependency relations (De Marneffe et al., 2006)
, Structural Well-formedness, Lexical Diversity,
Sentence Cohesion, Causality and Informative-
ness of the text.

The lexical diversity of a given text is deﬁned
as the ratio of different unique word stems (types)
to the total number of words (tokens). According
to Jarvis’s model (Jarvis, 2002), lexical diversity
includes six properties that are measured by the
indices discussed in Table 1.

We device a novel algorithm to determine cohe-
sion between sentences in a document. The algo-
rithm follows the following steps: a) identify the
GloVe word embeddings(Pennington et al., 2014)
of each constituent word of two sentences S1, /S2.

b) create sentence embeddings by computing a
tensor product between the individual word em-
beddings. For example, given two sentences S1
and S2 S1 = w1, w2..., wi and S2 = w(cid:48)
2, ...w(cid:48)
j,
where w1, w2, ...wk and w(cid:48)
k are the word
embeddings of S1 and S2. Sentence embedding
SE(S1) is (w1

(cid:78) w2)(cid:78) w3)...(cid:78) wk). Where
(cid:78) refers to the tensor product of each adjacent

are computed as: S(cid:48) = (cid:80)∀wi∈C1

word embedding pairs in S1. Similarly for sen-
tence S2. c) deﬁne A and B as the number of
word embeddings in S1 andS2 respectively. d)
the cohesion score between S1 and S2 can be
computed as coh(S1, S2) = (S(cid:48)+Sim(p1,p2))
The
expression N1 represents A ∪ B. S(cid:48) and S(cid:48)(cid:48)

sentence embeddings of S1 and S2 respectively,
and Sim(x, y) is the cosine similarity between
two vector Vi and Vj.

To indicate presence of causality, we use the
semantic features as identiﬁed by Girju (Girju,
2003) - nine noun hierarchies (H(1) to H(9)) in
WordNet, namely, entity, psychological feature,
abstraction, state, event, act, group, possession,
and phenomenon. A single feature Primary Causal

If wi ∈
Class (PCC) is deﬁned for a word wi.
Hi where Hi is as deﬁned, P CC = Hi, else
P CC = null. Another feature, Secondary Causal
Class(SCC) is also deﬁned. This takes value H(i)
if any WordNet synonym of the word belongs to
H(i), and is N ull otherwise.

The informativeness of a text refers to how
much information is present in a text with re-
spect to a given collection. We have introduced
an information theoretic approach towards deter-
mining such informativeness in text. We consider
each document d, represented by a bag-of-word
as, < (q1, w1), (q2, w2), ..., (qn, wn) > where qi
is the ith unique term in document d and wi is the
corresponding weight computed with respect to a
collection of documents C. The Informativeness
score N S(d, C) of each new text document d, is
computed with respect to the collection C, indi-
cating the informativeness of d amongst C. In the
described context, we declare a document di as in-
formative when the corresponding N S(di, C) is
higher than a threshold θ. We have deﬁned the in-
formativeness of d in terms of its information con-
tent (IC). Information content is a heuristic mea-
sure for term speciﬁcity and is a function of term
use. Our idea is to therefore use it as an estima-
tor of informativeness an informative document
is more likely to use unique vocabulary than other
documents. We compute the information content
of a document in terms of its Entropy. We de-
(cid:80)n
ﬁne the entropy of a text T , with N words out
of which n are unique, as:ET (p1, p2, ..., pn) =
i=1(pi∗(log10 N −log10 pi). pi(i = 1...n) is
1
N

96the probabilistic measure of the speciﬁcity of the
ith word in the T . The technique to compute term
speciﬁcity is discussed below.
In order to avoid
the problem of zero probabilities, we have used
linear interpolation smoothing, where document
weights are smoothed against the set of the docu-
ments in the corpus. Then the probabilities are de-
ﬁned as:θdn(q) = λ∗θd(q)+(1−λ)∗θd1...θdn(q).
Where, λ ∈ [0, 1] is the smoothing parameter and
is the probability of term q in the corpus C. In our
experiments, λ was set to 0.9.

As discussed earlier,

the cornerstone of our
informativeness prediction engine is to compute
the rarity of a document, which can, in turn, be
computed by determining the rarity of individual
terms. Accordingly, we have applied the principle
of Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) (Karkali
et al., 2014). Aggregating all the IDF of the terms
of a given document may led us to a better estima-
tor of the documents Informativeness. IDF is orig-
inally deﬁned as,IDF (q, C) = log( N
) where, q
dfq
is the term in hand, dfq is the document frequency
of the term q across the corpus C and N is the
total number of documents in the collection. On
the other hand, in probabilistic terms IDF can be
computed as:IDFp(q, c) = log( N−dfq

).

3.2 Model architecture

The proposed linguistically informed convolution
recurrent neural network architecture that we have
used in this paper is illustrated in Figure 1. In the
next few subsections, we describe each layer in de-
tail.

Generating Embeddings: Pre-trained GloVe
word vector representations of dimension 300
have been used for this work (Pennington et al.,
2014) for the word embeddings. Similarly we
have constructed a pre-trained sentence vectors.
The Sentence vectors from each input essay is ap-
pended with the vector formed from the linguistic
features identiﬁed for that particular sentence.

Convolution Layer: Since convolution net-
works works best in determining local features
from texts, it is important to feed each of the gen-
erated word embeddings to a convolution layer.
Accordingly, the convolution layer applies a lin-
ear transformation to all K windows in the given
sequence of vectors. We perform a zero padding to
ensure the same dimensionality between the input
and output vectors. Therefore, given a word rep-
resentations X1, X2, ...Xl, the convolution layer

ﬁrst concatenates these vectors to form a vec-
tor ¯x of length l.dLT and then uses Conv(¯x) =
W.¯(x) + b to calculate the output vector of length
dc. Where, W and b are the weights that the net-
work learns.

Long short-term memory In AES systems,
the surrounding context is of paramount informa-
tion. While typical LSTMs allow the preceding
elements to be considered as context for an ele-
ment under scrutiny, we prefer to use bidirectional
LSTMs (Bi-LSTM) networks (Graves et al., 2012)
that are connected so that both future and past se-
quence context (i.e. both preceding and succeed-
ing elements) can be examined. Corresponding to
each input text, we determine the word embedding
representation (We) of each word of the text and
the different linguistic feature embeddings (Wl).
The input to the Bi-LSTM unit is an embedding
vector E which is the composition of We and Wl,
i.e.

(cid:78)−→

−→
E =

−→
We

Wl

Activation layer: After obtaining the inter-
mediate hidden layers from the Bi-LSTM layer
h1, h2, ..., hT , we use an attention pooling layer
over the sentence representations. The attention
pooling helps to acquire the weights of sentence
contribution to ﬁnal quality of the text. The at-
tention pooling over sentences is represented as:

(cid:80)(αi.hi). Where Wa, wα are weight matrix and
ai = tanh(Wa.hi + ba), αi = ewα.ai(cid:80) ewα.ai , O =

vector respectively, ba is the bias vector, ai is at-
tention vector for i-th sentence, and αi is the at-
tention weight of i-th sentence. O is the ﬁnal text
representation, which is the weighted sum of all
the sentence vectors.

The Sigmoid Activation Function: The linear
layer performs a linear transformation of the input
vector that maps it to a continuous scalar value.
We apply a sigmoid function to limit the possi-
ble scores to the range [0, 1]. The mapping of the
linear layer after applying the sigmoid activation
function is given by s(x) = sigmoid(w.x + b).
Where, x is the input vector, w is the weight vec-
tor, and b is bias value. We normalize all gold-
standard scores to [0, 1] and use them to train the
network. However, during testing, we rescale the
output of the network to the original score range
and use the rescaled scores to evaluate the system.

4 Experiments

4.1 Dataset

An Automated Student Assessment Prize (ASAP)
contest was hosted at Kaggle in 2012.
It was
supported by the Hewlett Foundation, aiming to
explore the capabilities of automated text scor-
ing systems (Shermis and Burstein, 2013). The
dataset released consists of around twenty thou-
sand texts (60% of which are marked), pro-
duced by middle-school English-speaking stu-
dents, which we use as part of our experiments to
develop our models. In order to train and test the
proposed models, we have used the same dataset
as published at the Kaggle challenge. Table 2 re-
ports some of the basic statistics about the dataset.
Due to the unavailability of the testing set, we
have performed a 7-fold cross validation to eval-
uate our proposed models. In each fold, 80% of
the data is used for training, 10% as the develop-
ment set, and 10% as the test set. We train the
model for a ﬁxed number of epochs (around 8000)
and then choose the best model based on the de-
velopment set. We have used the NLTK toolkit to
perform various NLP tasks over the given dataset.
For ease of experimentation, we have further nor-
malized the expert scores (gold-standard scores) to
the range of [0, 1]. During testing, we rescale the
system-generated normalized scores to the origi-
nal range of scores and measure the performance.

4.2 Training and parameter estimation
For a given learning function our goal is to min-
imize the mean squared error (MSE) rate. Ac-
cordingly, we have used the RMSProp optimiza-
tion algorithm (Dauphin et al., 2015) to mini-
mize the mean squared error (MSE) loss func-
tion over the training data. This is represented
i=1(si − s∗
as: M SE(s∗, s) = 1
i )2. There-
fore, given N training samples and their corre-
sponding expert generated scores p∗
i normalized
within a range of [0.1], the model computes the
predicted scores pi for all training essays and then
updates the network parameters such that the mean
squared error is minimized.

N ∗(cid:80)N

The 10% data kept for development is used
to identify the different hyper-parameters for the
models. There are several hyper-parameters that
need to be set. We use the RMSProp optimizer
with decay rate (ρ) set to 0.9 to train the net-
work and we set the base learning rate to 0.001.
The mini-batch size is 64 in our experiments and
we train the network for 400 epochs. We have
also make use of dropout regularization (Srivas-
tava et al., 2014) to avoid over-ﬁtting. We also clip
the gradient if the norm of the gradient is larger
than a threshold. We do not use any early stop-
ping methods, instead, we train the neural network
model for a ﬁxed number of epochs and monitor
the performance of the model on the development
set after each epoch. Once training is ﬁnished, we
select the model with the best QWK score on the
development set. During training, the norm of the
gradient is clipped to a maximum value of 10. We
set the word embedding dimension (dLT ) to 50
and the output dimension of the recurrent layer
(dr) to 300. For the convolution layer, the win-
dow size (l) is set to 5 and the output dimension
of this layer (dc) is set to 50. The details of the
hyper-parameters are summarized in Table 3.

4.3 Evaluation
In past literature, a number of techniques were
used to measure the quality of AES systems. This
includes Pearson’s correlation r, Spearman’s rank-
ing correlation ρ, Kendall’s Tau and kappa, and
quadratic weighted kappa (QWK). (Alikaniotis
et al., 2016) proposed to evaluate their model in
terms of the ﬁrst three parameters, whereas works
of (Taghipour and Ng, 2016; Dong and Zhang,
2016; Dong et al., 2017) uses QWK as the evalua-
tion criteria. This is primarily due to the fact that

competition ofﬁcial criteria takes QWK as evalua-
tion metric.

The QWK statistics or its other variants are
widely used to measure inter-rater agreement of
the annotators or experts. In our case inter-raters
refer to the human rater and the system predicted
ratings. QWK is modiﬁed from kappa which takes
quadratic weights. The quadratic weight matrix in
QWK is deﬁned as: Wi,j = (i−j)2
(R−1)2 , where i and
j are the reference rating (assigned by a human
rater) and the system rating (assigned by an AES
system), respectively, and R is the number of pos-
sible ratings.

An observed agreement score O is calculated
such that Oi,j refers to the number of essays that
receive a rating i by the human rater and a rat-
ing j by the AES system. An expected score E is
calculated as the outer product of the two ratings.
Finally, given the three matrices W, O, and E, the

QWK value is calculated as:κ = 1 − (cid:80)(Wi,j∗Oi,j )
(cid:80)(Wi,j∗Ei,j )

known state-of-the-art models. These models are:
a) the publicly available ’Enhanced AI Scoring
Engine’ (EASE1). EASE is based on hand-crafted
linguistic features and regression methods includ-
ing support vector regression (SVR) and Bayesian
linear ridge regression (BLRR). In the present pa-
per we have used only the BLRR model as our
baseline systems due to its improved performance
in comparison to the SVR model. b) The LSTM-
MoT models proposed by (Taghipour and Ng,
2016). c) the Attention-based Recurrent Convo-
lution Neural Network model proposed by (Dong
et al., 2017). d) The hierarchical CNN (CNN-
CNN-MoT)(Dong and Zhang, 2016) and e) the hi-
erarchical CNN layer with LSTM along with an
additional attention layer (CNN-LSTM-att) (Dong
and Zhang, 2016) (Dong et al., 2017) as our base-
lines.

The LSTM-MoT uses one layer of LSTM over
the word embeddings, and takes the average pool-
ing over all time-step states as the ﬁnal text repre-
sentation, which is called Mean-over-Time (MoT)
pooling (Taghipour and Ng, 2016). Next, a lin-
ear layer with sigmoid function follows the MoT

model by comparing it with some of the well

the other hand, CNN-CNN-MoT uses two layers
of CNN, in which one layer operates over each
sentence to obtain representation for each sentence
and the other CNN is stacked above, followed by
mean-over-time pooling to get the ﬁnal text rep-
resentation. Similarly, the CNN-LSTM-att model
uses hierarchical architecture with the CNN layer
followed by an LSTM layer attached with an at-
tention layer instead of the MoT layer(Dong et al.,
2017).

Table 4 reports the comparison of the perfor-
mance of our system and the existing baselines by
taking the eight prompts from the Kaggle ASAP
dataset individually.
In general we can observe
that our proposed performance of the proposed
Qe-CLSTM model is comparable to that of the ex-
isting baseline systems. However, in certain cases
it outperforms all the base-line models. For ex-
ample, in prompt 3, 6 and 7 we have achieved an
QWK of 0.712, 0.831 and 0.815 respectively as
compared to the best reported average QWK score
of 0.694, 0.827 and .0.811 respectively for the 10
fold run of CNN-LSTM and LSTM only.

It is worth mentioning here that all these mod-
els are compared with respect to the QWK score.
On the other hand, we have also used evalua-
tion matrices like, Pearson’s correlation r, Spear-
man’s ranking correlation ρ, RMSE scores in or-
der to compare our model with systems proposed
by (Alikaniotis et al., 2016).

Table 5 shows the comparison of the perfor-
mance of our system and the existing baselines by
taking all the prompts together. We have compared
the systems with respect to the different models as
discussed in 5. We found that that in terms of all
these parameters our system performs better than
the existing, LSTM, Bi-LSTM and EASE mod-
els. We have achieved a Pearson’s and Spearman’s
correlation of 0.94 and 0.97 respectively as com-
pared to that of 0.91 and 0.96 in (Alikaniotis et al.,
2016). We also achieved and RMSE score of 2.09.
We also compute a pair wise Cohen’s κ value of
0.97.

Apart from scoring each of the individual es-
says, we also tried to analyze some of the typical
cases where our model fails to predict the desired
output. Figure 2 shows the general distribution of
difference in average expert score and the system
predicted score. We observe a minimum differ-
ence of 0 and maximum difference of 20 with me-

scores with respect to the actual score

dian of 1 and average of 1.08. In 82% cases the
difference lies between the range of [0,1].

6 Conclusion

In this paper, we have proposed a novel technique
that uses deep neural network model to perform
Automatic Essay Assessment task. The tradi-
tional way of applying deep neural nets like CNN,
LSTM or their other forms fails to identify the
interconnection between the different factors in-
volved in assessing the quality of a text. To ad-
dress this issue, our method not only rely upon
the pre-trained word or sentence representations
of text, but also takes into account qualitatively
enhanced features such as, lexical diversity, infor-
mativeness, cohesion, well-formedness etc., that
have proved to be important in determining text
quality. Further, we have explored a variety of
neural network model architectures for automated
essay scoring and have achieved signiﬁcant im-
provements over baseline in certain cases. We
would like to conclude that it is indeed possible
to enhance the performance of such AES system
by intelligently incorporating the supporting lin-
guistic features into the model. One of the limi-
tations of the present approach is that all the lin-
guistic and qualitative features used in this work
are computed off-line and then fed into the deep
learning architecture. However, in principle deep
learning models are supposed to learn these fea-
tures apriori and perform accordingly. Therefore,
one possible future directions of this work is to de-
velop or modify the existing intermediate scores in
such a way that the task speciﬁc models can auto-
matically learn these features.
