Abstract

This paper examines a method to improve
the user impression of a spoken dialog
system by introducing a mechanism that
gradually changes form of utterances ev-
ery time the user uses the system. In some
languages, including Japanese, the form of
utterances changes corresponding to social
relationship between the talker and the lis-
tener. Thus, this mechanism can be ef-
fective to express the system’s intention
to make social distance to the user closer;
however, an actual effect of this method is
not investigated enough when introduced
to the dialog system.
In this paper, we
conduct dialog experiments and show that
controlling the form of system utterances
can improve the users’ impression.

1 Introduction

Demand for a spoken dialog system has raised, in-
cluding AI speakers or personal assistant systems
(Bellegarda, 2014). Not only the conventional
task-oriented dialog systems (Aust et al., 1995;
Zue et al., 2000), but also non-task-oriented sys-
tems (Bickmore and Picard, 2005; Meguro et al.,
2010; Yu et al., 2016; Akasaki and Kaji, 2017)
have attracted the attention in recent years. In or-
der for such dialog systems to become ubiquitous
in the society, it is important to improve the user
impression to the dialog with the system.

Miyashita et al. (2008) conducted a research
that increases the user’s intention to talk with the
system by gradually increasing the behavior of a
robot that expresses intimacy. Their study showed
that the user felt the robot more friendly and in-
creased desire to use the robot continuously by the
robot’s behavior. This research showed that, ex-

pressing intimacy with the user is effective to pro-
mote the user’s desire to use the system.

In this research, we focused on a linguistic form
of system utterances to improve the user impres-
sion. Several languages, including Japanese, have
a mechanism called “honoriﬁcs” by which the
speech form changes according to the relative so-
cial position or closeness of the social distance to
the dialog partner (Brown and Ford, 1961). The
honoriﬁc is often treated as one of the categories of
politeness (Brown and Levinson, 1978, 1987) al-
though several arguments have been raised (Ide,
1989; Agha, 1994). Brown and Levinson (1987)
claimed that the speaker can choose strategy ac-
cording to the politeness level depending on the
social distance or relative power between the
speakers.
In Japanese, the speakers try to close
the social distance by gradually decreasing the use
of honoriﬁc form.

This paper examines effectiveness of intro-
ducing such mechanism to the dialog sys-
tem. Kim et al. (2012) conducted experiments of
human-robot interaction in Korean language, and
indicated that the robot is perceived more friendly
when calling the user in the familiar form, but
the effect of the speech form itself was limited.
In contrast, we investigate the effect of changing
speech form on the user impression including the
friendliness.

2 Changing Form of System Utterances

Considering Social Distance

2.1 Expressions of Japanese for social
distance, politeness and familiarity

This study exploits the expressions of Japanese
that express politeness and social distance be-
tween the talker and the listener. Thus, we ﬁrst
explain such mechanism of Japanese brieﬂy. The
Japanese language has a system of speaking form

ProceedingsoftheSIGDIAL2018Conference,pages235–240,Melbourne,Australia,12-14July2018.c(cid:13)2018AssociationforComputationalLinguistics235called “the honoriﬁcs (keigo)”, that indicates so-
cial relationships between the speaker and the lis-
tener or the speaker and the persons referred in
the utterance using the linguistic form. For ex-
ample, the verb tsukuru (to make) can be used as
either tsukuru (normal form) or tsukuri-masu (po-
lite form). Another way of expressing closeness is
to use the ending particles, such as tsukuri-masu
(polite, far) or tsukuri-masu-yo (polite, closer). In
addition to the honoriﬁcs, it is possible to express
closeness using different wording, such as hai (a
positive answer or a backchannel, polite) and un
(casual). When the interlocutors are familiar with
each other, the form of utterances become less po-
lite, closer and more casual. In this experiment,
we deﬁned “honoriﬁc form” as polite, less close
and formal expressions, and “normal form” as less
polite, closer and casual expressions.

2.2 Gradual control of system speech form

based on speech level shift

The changes of the speech form are caused by
several factors, such as the social entrainment
(Hirschberg, 2008). One of the main factors is the
changes of the social distance. When two persons
make conversations several times,
it was men-
tioned that the proportion of honoriﬁc form de-
creases, and that of normal form increases as they
make more conversations (Ikuta, 1983). This phe-
nomenon is called “speech level shift” or “speech
style shift” (Ikuta, 1983; Hasegawa, 2004). The
“speech level” or “speech style” means the expres-
sions in the utterances that express closeness of the
interlocutors. Thus, the “speech level shift” means
the switching of speech level that occurs in conver-
sations between the same persons.

To make the dialog system express that the sys-
tem and the user gradually become more friendly,
we propose a method to use the speech level shift.
In the experiment, the subjects talked with the sys-
tem for three consecutive days and evaluated the
impression on the system and the dialog with the
system. We changed the speech level step by step
within the three-day experiment, as shown in Ta-
ble 1. In Japanese, it is natural to use the honoriﬁc
form when persons meet for the ﬁrst time; thus,
all of the system utterances were in the honoriﬁc
form in the ﬁrst conversation.

3 Experimental Dialog System

3.1 System architecture
An experimental system is based on an example-
based dialog system (Takeuchi et al., 2007;
Lee et al., 2009) commonly used for the non-
task-oriented system. A computer-based female
agent was employed. In the example-based dialog
system,
the system calculates the similarities
between the user’s utterance and example sen-
tences in the database, and then selects a response
corresponding to the most similar example. This
study employed the cosine similarity for the
similarity calculation.

3.2 Topic-dependent example-response

database for non-task-oriented dialog

The example-response databases for the exper-
iments were constructed through the actual di-
alogs with the system and users (Kageyama et al.,
2017). We focused on chatting between friends,
which is one of the non-task-oriented dialog, and
prepared four databases corresponding to the dif-
ferent dialog topic. To collect the dialog data, the
users asked the agent what she had done yester-
day on the assumption that she had led a human-
like life in the dialog collection. The topics of
the database were cooking, movies, and meal.
A dialog example is appended at Appendix A.
The number of pairs included in the constructed
database was ranged from 1,000 to 1,125. The re-
sponses of the system were composed in the hon-
oriﬁc form.

3.3 Preparation of the system utterances in

normal form

The databases of the normal form were con-
structed by rewriting the form of the response
sentences of the collected databases. 26 persons
rewrote the sentences into the normal form. In the
rewriting, the rewriting rules shown at Appendix
B were provided to the rewriters for the consis-

236tency.

4 Dialog Experiments by Gradually

Changing Expression
4.1 Experimental condition
The experiments were conducted in a sound-proof
chamber for 3 consecutive days. The participants
interacted with the system once a day, where a par-
ticipant made 10 utterances to control the num-
ber of interchanges. The topic of the conversa-
tion was different from day to day, where the or-
der of the topics was randomly determined from
participant to participant. The rate of the system
utterances in the honoriﬁc and normal form was
changed according to Table 1. After the conversa-
tion, they evaluated the impression on the spoken
dialog system using a questionnaire. For compari-
son, we prepared the dialog systems speaking in
only the honoriﬁc form and the normal form in
all three days. These two systems are denoted as
“Honoriﬁc” and “Normal” hereafter. In the exper-
iments, 14 participants talked with one of the three
systems, and thus the total number of the partici-
pants was 42 (3 systems (cid:2) 14 participants). Each
group contained 7 male and 7 female participants.
We ﬁrst presented the participants all the top-
ics the dialog system could handle, and the par-
ticipants were instructed to ask what the agent did
yesterday for the speciﬁc topic. We also presented
a dialog example to the participants. Then the par-
ticipants made conversation with the system on the
presented topic. The participants were allowed to
make self-disclosure utterances.

We expected the system and the participant
made conversations within the given topic, but
the conversation broke down when the participant
made an unanticipated utterance. The participants
were instructed to talk with the system until mak-
ing the speciﬁed number of utterances even when
the conversation broke down.

4.2 Procedure of dialog experiments
The experimental procedure is as below:

Step 1: The topic is announced to the participant.
Step 2: The participant asks the system what the

agent did yesterday.

Step 3: The participant made 10 interchanges

with the system.

Step 4: The participant answered a questionnaire

on the impression of the dialog.

Step 5: The steps 1 to 3 were repeated for 3 con-

secutive days changing the topic every day

4.3 Evaluation method
At the end of the every conversation, the partici-
pants answered the following four questions using
the ﬁve-grade Likert scale, one (not at all) to ﬁve
(very much).

Satisfaction: How the participant was satisﬁed

with the dialog

Friendliness: How friendly the participant felt

the dialog system

Impression of speech form: How adequate the

participant felt of the system’s speech form

Intention of talk: How strongly the participant

wants to use the system again

In addition, we asked the participants who talked
with the proposed system, whether they noticed
the changes of the speech form or not after the last
experiment.

5 Analysis of Experimental Results
5.1 Analysis of response rates
Table 2 shows the rates of the correct answers
made by the system in the experiments. The cor-
rectness was judged by the participant based on
the naturalness of the response to the question.

As shown in the table, the rate of correct answer
of each system through three days experiments is
about 70%, and this is almost equal to the pre-
vious results (Kageyama et al., 2017). From the
one-way layout ANOVA factoring the condition
of speech form, the signiﬁcant difference was not
observed. Therefore, the effect of response error
in the subjective evaluation is considered to be al-
most equal between systems.

5.2 Experimental results of subjective

evaluation

tive evaluation per day. The graph shows that the

increase day by day, whereas those of the “Hon-
oriﬁc” and the “Normal” systems tend to be ﬂat.
The scores of “Proposed” and “Honoriﬁc” are al-
most same at the ﬁrst day because the all of utter-
ances conducted in the honoriﬁc form.
Interest-
ingly, we can observe the difference between the
scores of “Proposed” and “Normal” at Day 3 even
both systems spoke in the same form. This result
reﬂects that the effect of the changing form of the
utterance by number of interactions.

Here, we conducted the two-way layout
ANOVA to compare the condition of the speech
form and the number of the interaction, and ob-
tained the signiﬁcant difference at the speech form
factor in Satisfaction (p (cid:20) 0:01; F = 3:07), Im-
pression of speech form (p = 0:01; F = 3:07),
and Friendliness (p (cid:20) 0:01; F = 3:07). Then, we
conducted the Tukey-Kramer tests to investigate
the difference between the conditions. The results
are summarized in Table 3.

As shown in the table, “Proposed” surpassed
“Honoriﬁc” in terms of Impression of speech
form, and surpassed “Normal” in terms of Sat-
isfaction and Friendliness. These results suggest
that the proposed system tends to obtain the better
subjective score comparing to the simple systems
without changing the form of utterance.

5.3 Perception of changes of speech form
In the experiments, 5 out of 14 participants that
used the proposed system did not perceive the
changes of the speech form. Here, we compared

Figure 2: Score depending on perception

the scores between the groups of participants who
perceived (denoted as “Perceived”) and did not
perceive (denoted as “Not-perceived”) the changes
of the form. Figure 2 shows the variation of the
average scores of each group. From the ﬁgure,
we can observe that all of the subjective scores of
“Not-perceived” tend to increase as same with the
scores of “Perceived.” This result suggests that it
is possible that the proposed method is able to im-
prove the user impression unconsciously.

6 Conclusion

In this paper, we examined a method to im-
prove the user impression by changing the form
of system utterance according to number of uses.
The dialog experiments showed that the proposed
method can improve the subjective scores, such
as the satisfaction compared to the simple systems
unchanging the speech form, even the user could
not perceive the changes of the expression.

In a future work, we will examine a method to
change the form of the sentences considering the
relationship between the speakers (Li et al., 2016).
