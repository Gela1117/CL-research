Abstract

Most Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) ap-
proaches are supervised methods which
require a signiﬁcant amount of annotated
corpus, and the annotation requires lin-
guistic expertise.
In this paper, we pro-
pose a Multi-Task Active Learning frame-
work for Semantic Role Labeling with En-
tity Recognition (ER) as the auxiliary task
to alleviate the need for extensive data
and use additional information from ER
to help SRL. We evaluate our approach
on Indonesian conversational dataset. Our
experiments show that multi-task active
learning can outperform single-task active
learning method and standard multi-task
learning. According to our results, active
learning is more efﬁcient by using 12%
less of training data compared to passive
learning in both single-task and multi-task
setting. We also introduce a new dataset
for SRL in Indonesian conversational do-
main to encourage further research in this
area1.

Introduction

Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) extracts predicate-
argument structures from sentences (Jurafsky and
Martin, 2006). It tries to recover information be-
yond syntax.
In particular, information that can
answer the question about who did what to whom,
when, why and so on (Johansson and Nugues,
2008; Choi et al., 2010).

There have been many proposed SRL tech-
niques, and the high performing models are mostly
supervised (Akbik and Li, 2016; Punyakanok
et al., 2004). As they are supervised methods,

the models are trained on a relatively large anno-
tated corpus. Building such corpus is expensive
as it is laborious, time-consuming, and usually re-
quires expertise in linguistics. For example, Prop-
Bank annotation guideline by Choi et al. (2010)
is around 90 pages so it can be a steep learning
curve even for annotators with a linguistic back-
ground. This difﬁculty makes reproducibility hard
for creating annotated data especially in low re-
source language or different domain of data. Sev-
eral approaches have been proposed to reduce the
effort of annotation. He et al. (2015) introduced
a Question Answering-driven approach by casting
a predicate as a question and its thematic role as
an answer in the system. Wang et al. (2017b) used
active learning using semantic embedding. Wang
et al. (2017a) utilized Annotation Projection with
hybrid crowd-sourcing to route between hard in-
stances for linguistic experts and easy instances
for non-expert crowds.

Active Learning is the most common method to
reduce annotation by using a model to minimize
the amount of data to be annotated while maxi-
mizing its performance. In this paper, we propose
to combine active learning with multi-task learn-
ing applied to Semantic Role Labeling by using
a related linguistic task as an auxiliary task in an
end-to-end role labeling. Our motivation to use a
multi-task method is in the same spirit as (Gorm-
ley et al., 2014) where they employed related syn-
tactic tasks to improve SRL in low-resource lan-
guages as multi-task learning.
Instead, we used
Entity Recognition (ER) as the auxiliary task be-
cause we think ER is semantically related with
SRL in some ways. For example, given a sen-
tence: Andy gives a book to John, in SRL con-
text, Andy and John are labeled as AGENT and
PATIENT or BENEFACTOR respectively, but in
ER context, they are labeled as PERSON. Hence,
although the labels are different, we hypothesize

ProceedingsoftheWorkshoponDeepLearningApproachesforLow-ResourceNLP,pages43–50Melbourne,AustraliaJuly19,2018.c(cid:13)2018AssociationforComputationalLinguistics43that there is some useful information from ER that
can be leveraged to improve overall SRL perfor-
mance.

Our contribution in this paper consists of two
parts. First, we propose to train multi-task ac-
tive learning with Semantic Role Labeling as the
primary task and Entity Recognition as the auxil-
iary task. Second, we introduce a new dataset and
annotation tags for Semantic Role Labeling from
conversational chat logs between a bot and human
users. While many of the previous work studied
SRL on large scale English datasets in news do-
main, our research aims to explore SRL in Indone-
sian conversational language, which is still under-
resourced.

2 Related Work

Active learning (AL) (Settles, 2012) is a
method to improve the performance of a learner by
iteratively asking a new set of hypotheses to be la-
beled by human experts. A well-known method is
Pool-Based AL, which selects the hypotheses pre-
dicted from a pool of unlabeled data (Lewis and
Gale, 1994). The most informative instance from
hypotheses is selected and added into labeled data.
The informativeness of an instance is measured by
its uncertainty, which is inversely proportional to
the learner’s conﬁdence of its prediction for that
instance. In other words, the most informative in-
stance is the one which the model is least conﬁdent
with.

There are two well-studied methods of se-
quence labeling with active learning. The ﬁrst one
is maximum entropy: given an input sentence x,
the probability of word xt having tag yt is given
by

pθ(yt|xt) =

(cid:80)K

t (xt|θ))

exp( ayt
j=1 exp( aj

t (xt|θ))

(1)

Where θ denotes a model parameters and K is
the number of tags. Uncertainty in maximum en-
tropy can be deﬁned using Token Entropy (TE) as
described in (Settles and Craven, 2008; Marcheg-
giani and Arti`eres, 2014).

t = −(cid:88)

From token level entropy (TE) in (2), we used a
simple aggregation such as summation to select an
instance. So that instance x is selected by Equa-
t=1(.)
is a summation term for greedy aggregation of sen-
tence level entropy.

Another well-studied sequence labeling method
with active learning is Conditional Random Fields
(CRFs) by Lafferty et al. (2001), where the prob-
ability of a sequence label y = {y1, y2, .., yT}
given a sequence of observed vectors x =
{x1, x2, .., xT} and a joint log-likelihood function
of unary and transition parameter ψ(yt−1, yt, xt)
is deﬁned as

pψ(y|x) =

t=1 ψ(yt−1, yt, xt)

y∈Y

t=1 ψ(yt−1, yt, xt)

(4)

Uncertainty in conditional random ﬁelds can be
obtained by Viterbi decoding by selecting instance
with maximum p(y|x) from a pool of unlabeled
instances as deﬁned below.

xVE = arg min

x

pψ(y(cid:63)|x)

(5)

where p(y(cid:63)|.) is a probability assigned by Viterbi
inference algorithm (Marcheggiani and Arti`eres,
2014).

Multi-Task Learning Instead of training one
task per model independently, one can use related
labels to optimize multiple tasks in a learning pro-
cess jointly. This method is commonly known as
Multi-Task learning (MTL) or as Parallel Transfer
Learning (Caruana, 1997). Our motivation to use
multi-task learning is to leverage ”easier” annota-
tion than Semantic Roles to regularize model by
using related tasks. Previous work on Multi-Task
learning on Semantic Role Labeling by Collobert
et al. (2011) did not report any signiﬁcant im-
provement for SRL task. A recent work (Maraso-
vic and Frank, 2017) used SRL as the auxiliary
task with Opinion Role Labeling as the main task.
Multi-Task Active Learning Previous work
on multi-task active learning (MT-AL) (Reichart
et al., 2008) was focused on formulating a method
to keep the performance across a set of tasks in-
stead of a single task. In multi-task active learn-
ing scenario, optimizing a set of task classiﬁers
can be regarded as a meta-protocol by combin-
ing each task query strategy into a single query
method. In one-sided task query scenario settings,

one selected task classiﬁer uncertainty strategy is
used to query unlabeled samples. In multiple task
scenario, the uncertainty of an instance is the ag-
gregate of classiﬁers uncertainties for all tasks.

3 Proposed Method

In this section, we explain on how we incorporated
both the AL and MTL in our neural network archi-
tecture. We used the state-of-the-art SRL model
from He et al. (2017) as our base model as shown
in Figure 1.

Our model is a modiﬁcation of He et al.’s work.
Our ﬁrst adjustment is to use CRF as the last layer
instead of softmax because of its notable superi-
ority found by Reimers and Gurevych (2017) for
both role labeling and entity recognition. In this
scenario, we used CRF layer for the primary task
(SRL) (Zhou and Xu, 2015) and softmax layer for
the auxiliary task. The auxiliary task acts as a
regularization method (Caruana, 1997). Second,
we used character embedding with Convolutional
Neural Networks as Characters Encoder (Ma and
Hovy, 2016), to handle out-of-vocabulary prob-
lem caused by misspelled words, slangs, and ab-
breviations common in informal chatting, as well
as word embedding and predicate indicator fea-
ture embedding as the input features for a High-
way LSTM.

In multi-task learning conﬁguration, we used
parameter sharing in embedding and sequence
encoder layers except for the outermost module
which is used for prediction for each speciﬁc
task. We optimized the parameters jointly by
minimizing the sum loss of L(ys, ye|x, θ, ψ) =
L( ˆys, ys|x, θ)+L( ˆye, ye|x, ψ), where the ﬁrst part

of the equation is the SRL loss and the second part
is the entity loss. SRL loss is computed by joint
log-likelihood of emissions with transition param-
eters in CRF from Equation 4 and entity loss is
computed using standard cross-entropy loss from
softmax output in Equation 1.

Multi-Task Active Learning

In multiple task
scenario, we used the rank combination by Re-
ichart et al. (2008) that combines each task query
strategy into an overall rank(xi) = rank(xi
VE) +
TE). Note that in both training one-sided
rank(xi
and combined rank multi-task active learning, we
returned all task gold labels to be trained in multi-
task models.

As a multi-task active learning baseline, instead
of one-sided AL which queries a pre-determined
task for all-iteration, we used random task selec-
tion to draw which task to use as the query strat-
egy in the i-th iteration. Random task selection
is implemented using random multinomial sam-
pling. The selected task is used for the query in-
stances using standard uncertainty sampling.

4 Dataset & Experiment

4.1 Dataset
This research presents the dataset of human users
conversation with virtual friends bot2. The an-
notated messages are user inquiries or responses
to the bot. Private information in the original
data such as name, email, and address will be
anonymized. Three annotators with a linguistic
background performed the annotation process. In
this work, we used a set of semantic roles adapted
for informal, conversational language. Table 1
shows some examples of the semantic roles. The
dataset consists of 6057 unique sentences which
contain predicates.

2https://kata.ai/case-studies/jemma

45The semantic roles used are a subset of Prop-
Bank (Palmer et al., 2005). Also, we added a new
role, GREET. In our collected data, Indonesian
people tend to call the name of the person they are
talking to. Because such case frequently co-occurs
with another role, we felt the need to differentiate
this previously mentioned entity as a new role. For
example, in the following sentence: Hi Andy! I
brought you a present can help refers ”you” role
as PATIENT to ”Andi” role as GREET instead of
left unassigned.

In our second task, which is Entity Recogni-
tion (ER), we annotated the same sentence after
the SRL annotation. We used common labels such
as PERSON, LOCATION, ORGANIZATION, and
MISC as our entity tags. Different from Named
Entity Recognition (NER), ER also tag nominal
objects such as ”I”, ”you” and referential loca-
tions like ”di sana (over there)”. While this tag-
ging might raise a question whether there are over-
lapping tags with SRL, we argue that entity la-
bels are less ambiguous compared to role argu-
ments which are dependent on the predicate. An
example of this case can be seen in Table 1, where
both of I and you are tagged as PERSON whereas
the roles are varied. In this task, we used semi-
automatic annotation tools using brat (Stenetorp
et al., 2012). These annotation were checked and
ﬁxed by four people and one linguistic expert.

4.2 Experiment Scenario
The purpose of the experiment is to understand
whether multi-task learning and active learning
help to improve SRL model performance com-
pared to the baseline model (SRL with no AL sce-
nario). In this section, we focus on several experi-
ment scenarios: single-task SRL, single-task SRL
with AL, MTL, and MTL with AL.

Model Architecture Our model architecture
consists of word embedding, character 5-gram en-
coder using CNN and predicate embedding as in-
puts, with 50, 50, and 100 dimension respec-
tively. These inputs are concatenated into a 200-
dimensional vector which then fed into two-layer
Highway LSTM with 300 hidden units.

Initialization The word embedding were ini-
tialized with unsupervised pre-trained values ob-
tained from training word2vec (Mikolov et al.,
2013) on the dataset. Word tokens were lower-
cased, while characters were not.

Training Conﬁgurations For training conﬁg-
urations, we trained for 10 epochs using AdaDelta
(Zeiler, 2012) with ρ = 0.95 and  = 1.e−6. We
also employed early stopping with patience set to
3. We split our data using 80% training, 10% val-
idation, and 10% test for the fully supervised sce-
nario. For the active learning scenario, we further
split the training data into labeled and unlabeled
data. We used two kinds of split, 50:50 and 85:15.
For the 50:50 scenario, we queried 100 sentences
for each epoch. For the 85:15 scenario, we used
a smaller query of 10 sentences in an epoch to
keep the number of queries less than the number
of available fully supervised training data in 10
epochs. This number of queried sentences was ob-
tained by tuning on the validation set.

As for the AL query method, in the single-task
SRL, we used random and uncertainty sampling
query. SRL with 100% training data and SRL with
random query serve as baseline strategies. In the
MTL SRL, we employed random task and rank-
ing.

5 Results & Analysis
We experimented with a low-resource conversa-
tional language by varying the task scenario, ac-
tive learning query strategy, and outset percentage
of data seed from training data. We report our re-
sults using Precision (P), Recall (R), and the F1
score (F1) computed by exact matching of gold
and predicted role spans. The report can be seen

in Table 2.

Our baseline multi-task (SRL+ER with no AL
scenario) learning model in this experiment has
a higher precision compared to the single-task
(SRL) model. From the initial 85% of labeled
training data scenario, our model in total requested
87% of the training data in 10 epochs. In this sce-
nario, our proposed method for multi-task active
learning using ranking combination can outper-
form the single-task active learning models. Fig-
ure 2 presents the F1 score learning curve for each
model.

Signiﬁcance test We performed two tails sig-
niﬁcance test (t-test) by using 5-fold cross vali-
dation from the training and the test parts of the
corpus. The multi-task learning model is better
compared to the single-task learning one (p <
0.05). However, the single-task and the multi-task
learning scenario are not signiﬁcantly better than
both multi-task active learning from 85% and 50%
training data scenario, since the p-value between
model pairs are greater than 0.05. Therefore, ac-
cepting the null hypothesis indicate that perfor-
mances between multi-task active learning with
50%/85% initial data and multi-task or single-task
with full dataset are comparable.

Figure 3: Confusion matrix for Multi-Task Active
Learning Model using 85% initial labeled data.

We draw a confusion matrix of the multi-task
active learning model with 85% initial training
data in Figure 3 to analyze our model perfor-
mance. We observe several common errors made
by the model. The largest mistakes from the ma-
trix are PATIENT false positive. The model incor-
rectly detected 59% of non-roles as PATIENT. An-
other prominent error is 21% false negative of total
gold roles. The model primarily failed to tag 37%
of gold BENEFACTOR and 35% of gold TIME.
Quite different from the English SRL, we found
that labels confusion happens less frequently than
other error types. Based on this percentage, we
investigated the error by drawing samples. In gen-
eral, we broke down the incorrect predictions into
several types of error.

False Negative Spans
False negatives in semantic role labeling are de-
ﬁned as the number of roles in the gold data that
do not have the corresponding span matches in
the model prediction. False negative for AGENT
encompasses 69% of errors from the total of 45
AGENT gold span role errors, while the errors in
TIME roles all occur in this error type. In Table
4, the left example shows that, the model failed
to tag ”ini komputer” (EN: This is a computer).
In the right example, the model did not recognize
”get rick nya3” as PATIENT. An interesting re-
mark is perhaps how the model failed to tag be-
cause the predicate is an unknown word in the
training vocabulary despite the use of characters
encoder to alleviate the out-of-vocabulary prob-
lem. While in the left example, predicate ”men-
jawab” is also an unknown word in the vocabulary

but not a mistyped word, the right sample’s predi-
cate ”di donlot” is an informal writing of the word
”download”.

In the 50% training data scenario, we found that
multi-task active learning model achieves less re-
call compared to the single-task active learning
model. The multi-task active learning with 50%
initial training data performance suffers from fail-
ing to tag 53% of BENEFACTOR label.

Boundary Error

Overall, we found that boundary errors contribute
to 22% of the total span exact match errors. For
example, we found that PATIENT boundary errors
mostly occurred because predicted role spans do

not match the continuation of subsequent role. As
shown in Table 5, the model failed to recognize
makanan (EN: food) as the continuation of info
(EN: info) from the top example. In the bottom
example, the model failed to predict the continua-
tion of a mistyped role ”sahabar”.

Role Confusion

Role confusion is deﬁned as the matching between
gold span and predicted span, but they have dif-
ferent labels. This error typically occurs the least
compared to the false negatives and boundary er-
rors. In total, it is only 7% of the total errors. The
most common incorrect prediction is between gold
PATIENT and prediction AGENT. As shown in

48Table 6 in the top sentence, the model incorrectly
labeled a PATIENT (Jemma) as an AGENT. Addi-
tionally, the model also incorrectly tagged BENE-
FACTOR as PATIENT. In the bottom sentence, the
word ”Aku” (EN: I) is not annotated as any roles
but detected as an AGENT by the model.

6 Conclusion & Future Work

In this paper, we applied previous state-of-the-art
deep semantic role labeling models on a low re-
source language in a conversational domain. We
propose to combine multi-task and active learn-
ing methods into a single framework to achieve
competitive SRL performance with less training
data, and to leverage a semantically related task
for SRL.

Our primary motivation is to apply the frame-
work for low resource languages in terms of
dataset size and domains.
Our experiments
demonstrate that active learning method performs
comparably well to the single-task baseline using
30% fewer data by querying a total of 3483 from
4845 sentences. This result can be increased fur-
ther marginally to outperform the baseline using
87% of the training data. Our error analysis re-
veals some different obstacles from English SRL
to work on in the future.

While He et al.’s model of deep layers of high-
way LSTM allows learning the relation between
a predicate and arguments explicitly, not all tasks
in multi-task learning have equal complexity that
needs deep layers. Søgaard and Goldberg (2016)
proposed a method to allow a model to predict
tasks with different complexities at different layer
depths. For example, predicting entity recognition
tag at lower layers or inserting predicate features
at higher layers in an LSTM, because entity recog-
nition does not need predicates as features and is
considered as a lower-level task compared to SRL.
Combining multi-task learning with an unsuper-
vised task such as language modeling (Rei, 2017)
is also a possible improvement in multi-task ac-
tive learning settings as a semi-supervised vari-
ant. Analyzing other active learning methods such
as query by committee, variance reduction (Set-
tles and Craven, 2008), and information density
(Wang et al., 2017b) in multi-task settings are also
a promising path in deep learning architectures.
