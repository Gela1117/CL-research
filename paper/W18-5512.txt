Abstract

Existing entailment datasets mainly pose prob-
lems which can be answered without attention
to grammar or word order. Learning syntax
requires comparing examples where different
grammar and word order change the desired
classiﬁcation. We introduce several datasets
based on synthetic transformations of natural
entailment examples in SNLI or FEVER, to
teach aspects of grammar and word order. We
show that without retraining, popular entail-
ment models are unaware that these syntac-
tic differences change meaning. With retrain-
ing, some but not all popular entailment mod-
els can learn to compare the syntax properly.
Introduction

1
Natural language inference (NLI) is a task to iden-
tify the entailment relationship between a premise
sentence and a hypothesis sentence. Given the
premise, a hypothesis may be true (entailment),
false (contradiction), or not clearly determined
(neutral). NLI is an essential aspect of natural
language understanding. The release of datasets
with hundreds of thousands of example pairs, such
as SNLI (Bowman et al., 2015) and MultiNLI
(Williams et al., 2018), has enabled the develop-
ment of models based on deep neural networks
that have achieved near human level performance.
However, high accuracies on these datasets do
not mean that the NLI problem is solved. Anno-
tation artifacts make it possible to correctly guess
the label for many hypotheses without even con-
sidering the premise (Gururangan et al., 2018; Po-
liak et al., 2018; Tsuchiya, 2018). Successful
trained systems can be disturbed by small changes
to the input (Glockner et al., 2018; Naik et al.,
2018).

In this paper, we show that existing trained NLI
systems are mostly unaware of the relation be-
tween syntax and semantics, particularly of how

word order affects meaning. We develop a tech-
nique, “adversarial distraction,” to teach networks
to properly use this information. The adversarial
distraction technique consists of creating pairs of
examples where information matching the premise
is present in the hypothesis in both cases, but dif-
fering syntactic structure leads to different entail-
ment labels. We generate adversarial distractions
automatically from SNLI and an NLI dataset de-
rived from FEVER (Thorne et al., 2018), thus aug-
menting the datasets. We observe the behavior of
several existing NLI models on the added exam-
ples, ﬁnding that they are mostly unaware that the
syntactic changes have affected the meaning. We
then retrain the models with the added examples,
and ﬁnd whether these weaknesses are limitations
of the models or simply due to the lack of appro-
priate training data.

2 Related work

Datasets for NLI: SNLI and MultiNLI are both
based on crowdsourced annotation.
In SNLI
all
the premises came from image captions
(Young et al., 2014), whereas MultiNLI collected
premises from several genres including ﬁction, let-
ters, telephone speech, and a government report.
SciTail (Khot et al., 2018) constructed more com-
plicated hypotheses based on multiple-choice sci-
ence exams, whose premises were taken from web
text. More recently, FEVER introduced a fact veri-
ﬁcation task, where claims are to be veriﬁed using
all of Wikipedia. As FEVER established ground
truth evidence for or against each claim, premises
can be collected with a retrieval module and la-
beled as supporting, contradictory, or neutral for
an NLI dataset.

Neural network based NLI systems: Dozens
of neural network based models have been submit-
ted to the SNLI leaderboard. Some systems have

ProceedingsoftheFirstWorkshoponFactExtractionandVERiﬁcation(FEVER),pages79–84Brussels,Belgium,November1,2018.c(cid:13)2018AssociationforComputationalLinguistics79been developed based on sentence representations
(Conneau et al., 2017; Nie and Bansal, 2017), but
most common models apply attention between to-
kens in the premise and hypothesis. We focus on
three inﬂuential models of this kind: Decompos-
able Attention (Parikh et al., 2016), ESIM (Chen
et al., 2017), and a pre-trained transformer net-
work (Radford et al., 2018) which obtains state-
of-the-art results for various NLI datasets includ-
ing SNLI and SciTail.

Adversarial examples for NLI systems: Jia
and Liang (2017) introduced the notion of distrac-
tion for reading comprehension systems by try-
ing to fool systems for SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al.,
2016) with information nearly matching the ques-
tion, added to the end of a supporting passage.
Glockner et al. (2018) showed that many NLI sys-
tems were confused by hypotheses that were iden-
tical to the premise except for the replacement of
a word by a synonym, hypernym, co-hyponym, or
antonym. Naik et al. (2018) found that adding the
same strings of words to NLI examples without
changing the logical relation could signiﬁcantly
change results, because of word overlap, negation,
or length mismatches.

Other work (Kang et al., 2018; Zhao et al.,
2018) aimed to improve model robustness in
the framework of generative adversarial networks
(Goodfellow et al., 2014). Ribeiro et al. (2018)
generated semantically equivalent examples using
a set of paraphrase rules derived from a machine
translation model.
In contrast to these kinds of
adversarial examples, we focus on the model not
being sensitive enough to small changes that do
change meaning.

3 Teaching Syntax

Our adversarial examples attack NLI systems from
a new direction: not in their failure to capture
the relations between words as in Glockner et al.
(2018), but their failure to consider the syntax and
word order in premises and hypotheses to decide
upon the entailment relation. As position-agnostic
approaches such as Decomposable Attention and
SWEM (Shen et al., 2018) provide competitive
baselines to existing datasets, the power of mod-
els to interpret token position information has not
been rigorously tested.

3.1 Passive voice
We ﬁrst evaluate and teach the use of the passive
voice. By changing a hypothesis to passive, we
can obtain a semantically equivalent hypothesis
with identical tokens except for a different conju-
gation of the verb, the insertion of the word “by,”
and a different word order.

To perform the conversion, we use semantic role
labeling results of SENNA (Collobert et al., 2011)
to identify verbs and their ARG0 and ARG1 rela-
tions. We change the form of the verb and move
the ARG0 and ARG1 phrases to opposite sides
of the verb to form the passive. Here, we use
head words identiﬁed in dependency parsing re-
sults and the part-of-speech tagging information
of the verb from spaCy (Honnibal and Johnson,
2015) to change the verb form correctly accord-
ing to the plurality of these nouns and the tense of
the verb. The transformation is applied only at the
root verb identiﬁed in dependency parsing output.
If the addition of the passive were the only
augmentation, models would not be learning that
word order matters. Thus, in the cases where the
original pair is an entailment, we add an adver-
sarial distraction where the label is contradiction,
by reversing the subject and object in the hypothe-
sis after transformation to passive. We call this the
passive reversal. We ﬁlter out cases where the root
verb in the hypothesis is a reciprocal verb, such
as “meet” or “kiss,” or a verb appearing with the
preposition “with,” so that the resulting sentence
is surely not implied by the premise if the original
is. For example, the hypothesis, “A woman is us-
ing a large umbrella” (entailment), generates the
passive example, “A large umbrella is being used
by a woman” (entailment), and the passive rever-
sal, “A woman is being used by a large umbrella”
(contradiction).

3.2 Person reversal
One weakness of adversarial distraction by passive
reversal is that many hypotheses become ridicu-
lous. A model leveraging language model infor-
mation can guess that a hypothesis such as “A man
is being worn by a hat” is a contradiction without
considering the premise.
Indeed, when we train
a hypothesis only baseline (Poliak et al., 2018)
with default parameters using the SNLI dataset
augmented with passive and passive reversal ex-
amples, 95.98% of passive reversals are classiﬁed
correctly from the hypothesis alone, while only

for each adversarial distraction.

67.89% of the original and 64.69% of the passive
examples are guessed correctly.

To generate more plausible adversarial distrac-
tions, we try reversing named entities referring to
people. Most person names should be equally
likely with or without reversal, with respect to a
language model, so the generated examples should
rely on understanding the syntax of the premise
correctly.

SNLI generally lacks named entities, because it
is sourced from image captions, so we consider
FEVER data instead. The baseline FEVER sys-
tem (Thorne et al., 2018) retrieves up to ﬁve sen-
tences of potential evidence from Wikipedia for
each claim, by comparing TFIDF scores. We label
each of these evidence/claim pairs as entailment or
contradiction, according to the claim label, if the
evidence appears in the ground truth evidence set,
and as neutral otherwise. Because the potential ev-
idence is pulled from the middle of an article, it
may be taken out of context with coreference rela-
tions unresolved. To provide a bit of context, we
preﬁx each premise with the title of the Wikipedia
page it comes from, punctuated by brackets.

Our person reversal dataset generates contra-
dictions from entailment pairs, by considering per-
son named entities identiﬁed by SENNA in the hy-
pothesis, and reversing them if they appear within
the ARG0 and ARG1 phrases of the root verb.
Again, we ﬁlter examples with reciprocal verbs
and the preposition “with.”
the
FEVER claim, “Lois Lane’s name was taken from
Lola Lane’s name” (entailment), leads to a per-
son reversal of “Lola Lane’s name was taken from
Lois Lane’s name” (contradiction).

For example,

To compare the plausibility of the examples,
we train the same hypothesis only baseline on the
FEVER dataset augmented with the person rever-
sals. It achieves 15.94% accuracy on the added ex-
amples, showing that the person reversals are more
plausible than the passive reversals.

3.3 Life spans
Our third adversarial distraction (birthday) in-
volves distinguishing birth and death date infor-
mation. It randomly inserts birth and death dates
into a premise following a person named entity, in
parentheses, using one of two date formats. If it
chooses a future death date, no death date is in-
serted. A newly generated hypothesis randomly
gives a statement about either birth or death, and
either the year or the month, with a label equally
balanced among entailment, contradiction, and
neutral. For half of the contradictions it simply
reverses the birth and death dates; otherwise it ran-
domly chooses another date. For the neutral exam-
ples it asks about a different named entity, taken
from the same sentence if possible.

For example, a birthday and death date are ran-
domly generated to yield the premise, “[Daenerys
Targaryen] Daenerys Targaryen is a ﬁctional char-
acter in George R. R. Martin’s A Song of Ice
and Fire series of novels, as well as the television
adaptation, Game of Thrones, where she is por-
trayed by Emilia Clarke (April 25, 860 – Novem-
ber 9, 920),” and hypothesis, “Emilia Clarke died
in April” (contradiction).

4 Evaluation

4.1 Experiments
We consider three NLI systems based on deep
neural networks: Decomposable Attention (DA)
(Parikh et al., 2016), ESIM (Chen et al., 2017),
and a Finetuned Transformer Language Model
(FTLM) (Radford et al., 2018). For Decompos-
able Attention we take the AllenNLP implemen-
tation (Gardner et al., 2017) without ELMo fea-
tures (Peters et al., 2018); for the others, we take
the releases from the authors. We modify the code
released for FTLM to support entailment classiﬁ-
cation, following the description in the paper.

For the FEVER-based datasets, for DA and
ESIM, we reweight each class in the training data

in inverse proportion to its number of examples.
This reweighting is necessary to produce nontriv-
ial (most frequent class) results; the NLI train-
ing set we derive from FEVER has 92% neutral,
6% entailment, and 2% contradiction examples.
FTLM requires no such reweighting. When eval-
uating on the original FEVER examples, we re-
port Cohen’s Kappa between predicted and ground
truth classiﬁcations, in addition to accuracy, be-
cause the imbalance pushes DA and ESIM below
the accuracy of a trivial classiﬁer.

Whereas FTLM uses a byte-pair encoding vo-
cabulary (Sennrich et al., 2016) that can represent
any word as a combination of subword tokens, DA
and ESIM rely on word embeddings from GloVe
(Pennington et al., 2014), with a single out-of-
vocabulary (OOV) token shared for all unknown
words. Therefore it is unreasonable to expect
DA and ESIM not to confuse named entities in
FEVER tasks. We extend each of these models
by allocating 10,000 random vectors for out-of-
vocabulary words, and taking a hash of each OOV
word to select one of the vectors. The vectors are
initialized from a normal distribution with mean 0
and standard deviation 1.

4.2 Results
When we train the three models using origi-
nal SNLI without augmentation, the models have
slightly lower performance on the passive exam-
ples than the original data. However, all three
models fail to properly classify the passive rever-
sal data: without training, it looks too similar to

the original hypothesis. The augmented data suc-
ceeds in training two out of three of the models
about the passive voice: ESIM and FTLM can
classify the passive examples with approximately
the accuracy of the original examples, and with
even higher accuracy, they can pick out the passive
reversals as preposterous. However, DA cannot do
better than guess whether a passive sentence is re-
versed or not. This is because its model is deﬁned
so that its output is invariant to changes in word
order. Because it must consider the possibility of
a passive reversal, its performance on the passive
examples actually goes down after training with
augmentations.

Person reversal also stumps all three models be-
fore retraining. Of course DA can get a person re-
versal right only when it gets an original example
wrong, because of its insensitivity to word order.
ESIM and FTLM ﬁnd person reversals to be more
difﬁcult than the original examples. Compared to
passive reversal, the lack of language hints seems
to make the problem more challenging. However,
the multitude of conditions necessary to perform
a person reversal makes the added examples less
than 1% of the overall training data.

No model trained on FEVER initially does bet-
ter than random guessing on the birthday problem.
By training with augmented examples, ESIM and
FTLM learn to use the structure of the premise
properly to solve this problem. DA learns some
hints after retraining, but essentially the problem
depends on word order, which it is blind to. It is
noteworthy that the performance of all three mod-

82els on the original data improves after the birth-
day examples are added, unlike the other two aug-
mentations, where performance remains the same.
Four percent of the original FEVER claims use
the word “born” or “died,” and extra practice with
these concepts proves beneﬁcial.

5 Discussion
We have taken two basic aspects of syntax, the
equivalence of passive and active forms of the
same sentence, and the distinction between sub-
ject and direct object, and shown that they are
not naturally learned through existing NLI training
sets. Two of the models we evaluated could mas-
ter these concepts with added training data, but the
Decomposable Attention model could not even af-
ter retraining.

We automatically generated training data to
teach these syntactic concepts, but doing so re-
quired rather complicated programs to manipulate
sentences based on parsing and SRL results. Gen-
erating large numbers of examples for more com-
plicated or rarer aspects of syntax will be chal-
lenging. An obvious difﬁculty in extending our
approach is the need to make a distraction tem-
plate that affects the meaning in a known way. The
other difﬁculty lies in making transformed exam-
ples plausible enough not to be rejected by lan-
guage model likelihood.
