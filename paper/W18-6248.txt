Abstract

2 Related Research

We aim to predict Flemish adolescents’ ed-
ucational track based on their Dutch social
media writing. We distinguish between the
three main types of Belgian secondary edu-
cation: General (theory-oriented), Vocational
(practice-oriented), and Technical Secondary
Education (hybrid). The best results are ob-
tained with a Naive Bayes model, i.e. an F-
score of 0.68 (std. dev. 0.05) in 10-fold cross-
validation experiments on the training data and
an F-score of 0.60 on unseen data. Many of
the most informative features are character n-
grams containing speciﬁc occurrences of chat-
speak phenomena such as emoticons. While
the detection of the most theory- and practice-
oriented educational tracks seems to be a rela-
tively easy task, the hybrid Technical level ap-
pears to be much harder to capture based on
online writing style, as expected.

Introduction

While some social variables, such as gender and
age, have often been studied in author proﬁling
(see e.g.
the overview paper by Reddy et al.
(2016)), educational track remains largely unex-
plored in this respect. The goal of this paper
is twofold: we aim to develop a model that ac-
curately predicts adolescents’ educational track
based on their language use in social media writ-
ing, and gain more insight in the linguistic char-
acteristics of youngsters’ educational background
through inspection of the most informative fea-
tures for this classiﬁcation task.
The paper is structured as follows: we start by dis-
cussing related research (Section 2). Next, we de-
scribe the corpus, as well as the three main types
of Belgian secondary education, i.e. the three class
labels in the classiﬁcation experiments (Section 3).
Finally, we discuss our methodology (Section 4)
and present the results (Section 5).

Related work on this topic is scarce; only some
studies in education proﬁling can be found, and
they examine the impact of tertiary (and not sec-
ondary) education, on text genres other than so-
cial media writing. Furthermore, Dutch is never
the language of interest. Estival et al. (2007), for
instance, approached tertiary education proﬁling
as a binary classiﬁcation task (none versus some
tertiary education) for a corpus of English emails.
They obtained promising results with an ensem-
ble learner (Bagging algorithm) using character-
based, lexical and structural text features while
explicitly excluding function words. Pennebaker
et al. (2014), however, stressed the importance of
function words in a related task: they linked stu-
dents’ writing in college admission essays to their
later performance in college. Obtaining higher or
lower grades appeared to be associated with the
use of certain function words, belonging to either
‘categorical’ or ‘dynamic’ writing styles. In pre-
vious work on language and social status, Pen-
nebaker (2011) had already pointed out the impor-
tance of pronouns: he described a more frequent
use of you- and we-words as more typical of high
status, as well as a less frequent use of I-words.
When we expand the scope of previous research
from proﬁling studies to other related linguis-
tic ﬁelds, we again conclude that this speciﬁc
topic is underresearched. There are many studies
on the characteristics of (youngsters’) computer-
mediated communication (CMC) (see e.g. Varn-
hagen et al. (2010), Tagliamonte and Denis (2008)
and many more) and even some on the interaction
between CMC and education (see e.g. Vandeker-
ckhove and Sandra (2016) for the impact of CMC
on school writing). However, the impact of edu-
cational track on adolescents’ online writing is not
addressed. For this speciﬁc topic, we can - to our

knowledge - only refer to our previous sociolin-
guistic work focusing on youngsters with distinct
secondary education proﬁles, in which we have
shown that teenagers in practice-oriented tracks
tend to deviate more from formal standard writ-
ing on social media, by using more typograph-
ical chatspeak features (e.g. emoji), more non-
standard lexemes (e.g. dialect words) and more
non-standard abbreviations (Hilte et al., 2018a,b).
While for all examined linguistic features, these
differences were very consistent between the two
‘poles’ of the continuum between theory and prac-
tice, i.e. General and Vocational students, the
Technical students did not always hold an inter-
mediate position, but their chat messages showed a
rather unpredictable linguistic pattern (Hilte et al.,
2018a,b). We investigate in this paper whether
these sociolinguistic results are conﬁrmed in ma-
chine learning experiments.

3 Data Collection
Our corpus consists of Flemish1 adolescents’ pri-
vate chat messages, written in Dutch on the social
media platforms Facebook Messenger and Whats-
App. The data were collected through school vis-
its during which the students were informed about
the research, and could voluntarily donate chat
messages. We asked for the students’ (and for mi-
nors, their parents’) consent to store and analyze
their anonymized texts.
The ﬁnal corpus contains 434 537 chat messages
(2 531 354 tokens) by 1384 authors. All authors
are Flemish high school students, aged 13-20, at-
tending one of the three main types of Belgian
secondary education: the theory-oriented General
Secondary Education (which prepares for higher
education), the practice-oriented Vocational Ed-
ucation (which prepares for a speciﬁc manual
profession) and the hybrid Technical Education,
which has both a strong theoretical and practical
focus (Flemish Ministry of Education and Train-

1I.e. living in Flanders, the Dutch-speaking part of Bel-

gium.

ing, 2017). An overview of the distributions in the
corpus can be found in Table 1.
We note that the Belgian secondary school sys-
tem is similar to that of several other countries.
The distinction between a vocational and an aca-
demic training is quite common (e.g. in Denmark,
Finland, Croatia, France, Paraguay, China, etc.).
The division between three main tracks (offering
a more general, technical and vocational program
respectively) is made in several countries as well
(e.g. Czech Republic, Italy, Turkey, etc.)2. Conse-
quently, the present classiﬁcation task transcends
the Belgian context and may be relevant in differ-
ent countries and cultures, too.

4 Methodology

In this section, we describe the preprocessing of
the data and the feature design (resp. Sections 4.1
and 4.2) as well as the experimental setup (Section
4.3).

4.1 Preprocessing
Since we will predict educational
track on a
participant-level, we must ensure to have sufﬁ-
cient data (and thus a fairly representative sample
of online writing) for each participant. For this
purpose, we deleted the participants who donated
fewer than 50 chat messages. Next, we divided the
remaining corpus in a training set (70% of the par-
ticipants), and a test set (15%). A second test set
(15%) was put aside for future experiments. This
division was random but stratiﬁed, i.e. every sub-
set contained the same proportion of participants
per educational track.

4.2 Feature Design
The features used in the classiﬁcation experiments
consist of general textual features and features rep-
resenting the frequency of typical chatspeak phe-
nomena.
The general features include frequencies for token

2en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_

secondary_education_systems_by_country

329n-grams (uni-, bi- and trigrams) and character n-
grams (bi-, tri- and tetragrams). In addition, av-
erage token and post length and vocabulary rich-
ness (type/token ratio) are taken into account as
well. Finally, we use the dictionary-based com-
putational tool LIWC (Pennebaker et al., 2001) in
an adaptation for Dutch by Zijlstra et al. (2004)
to count word frequencies for semantic and gram-
matical categories. While counts for individual
words are already captured by the token unigrams,
these counts per category can allow for broader
generalizations for words which are semantically
or functionally related. However, we note that the
accuracy of this feature might not be optimal, as
the social media texts are very noisy (and contain
many non-standard elements, e.g. in terms of or-
thography or lexicon), whereas LIWC is based on
standard Dutch word lists.
The set of chatspeak features contains counts for
occurrences of several typographic phenomena. It
includes the number of character repetitions (e.g.
‘suuuuuper nice!!!’) and combinations of ques-
tion and exclamation marks (e.g. ‘what?!’). The
number of unconventionally capitalized tokens is
added as well (alternating, inverse or all caps, e.g.
‘AWESOME’). The ﬁnal typographic features are
emoticons and emoji (e.g.
:), <3), the rendition
of kisses and hugs (e.g. ‘xoxoxo’), hashtags for
topic indication (e.g. ‘#addicted’) and ‘mentions’
for addressing a speciﬁc person in a group con-
versation (e.g. ‘@sarah’). We also add an ono-
matopoeic variable, i.e. the number of renditions
of laughter (e.g.
‘hahahahah’). Another typi-
cal element of chatspeak are non-standard abbre-
viations and acronyms (e.g.
‘brb’ for ‘be right
back’). The ﬁnal feature concerns language or reg-
ister choice per token, in order to explicitly take
into account the authors’ use of words in a dif-
ferent language or linguistic variety than standard
Dutch. We count the number of standard Dutch,
English, and non-standard Dutch (e.g. dialect) lex-
emes. While the other chatspeak features are de-
tected with regular expressions (typographic and
onomatopoeic markers) or predeﬁned lists (abbre-
viations), this lexical feature is extracted using a
dictionary-based pipeline approach. For each to-
ken, we ﬁrst checked if it was an actual word (and
not e.g. an emoticon). Next, we checked if it oc-
curred in a list of standard Dutch words and named
entities. If not, we checked its presence in a stan-
dard English word list. Finally, if the token was

absent again, it was placed in the ‘non-standard
Dutch’ category. Figure 1 shows a sample of au-
thentic chat messages from the corpus, illustrating
the use of several chatspeak features.
For each participant, an individual feature vector
was created containing the counts for all of these
features. We proceeded with relative counts (to
normalize for submission size) by dividing the ab-
solute counts by the author’s total number of to-
kens (e.g. for token unigrams, emoji, ) or n-grams
(for n-gram frequencies). For initial dimensional-
ity reduction, we applied a frequency cutoff, only
taking features into account that are used at least
10 times in the corpus, by at least 5 different par-
ticipants.

4.3 Experimental Setup
We compared different models to predict Flem-
ish adolescents’ educational track based on their
social media messages. The classiﬁcation al-
gorithms we tested were: Support Vector Ma-
chines, Naive Bayes (Multinomial, Gaussian and
Bernoulli), Decision Trees, Random Forest, and
Linear Regression. For all classiﬁers, we used
the Scikit-learn implementation (Pedregosa et al.,
2011). For each model, we searched for the op-
timal parameter settings through a randomized
cross-validation search on the training data. We
searched for optimal values for classiﬁer-bound
parameters (e.g.
kernel for SVM), as well as
an optimal feature scaler (no scaling, MinMax
scaling or binarization) and an optimal percentile
for univariate (chi-square based) feature selection,
chosen from a continuous distribution. We com-
pared the models’ performance in 10-fold cross-
validation experiments on the training data.

5 Results
In Section 5.1, we discuss the best model resulting
from the 10-fold cross-validation experiments on
the training data and compare it to different base-
line models. In addition, we inspect the most in-
formative features for the task. In Section 5.2, we
discuss additional experiments which provide fur-
ther insight in the classiﬁcation problem.

5.1 Model Performance and Feature

Inspection

The best performing model in CV-setting on the
training data is a Multinomial Naive Bayes clas-
siﬁer, with optimized parameters:
the value for
the smoothing parameter alpha is 0.98, and the
model uses the 12.50% best features (according
to chi-square tests). The features were bina-
rized. The classiﬁcation report (Table 2) indi-
cates that the performance is good, with a value
of 0.68 for (prevalence-weighted macro-average)
precision, recall and F-score (std. dev. 0.05).
While precision is very similar for the three ed-
ucational levels, recall is good for General Edu-
cation, but slightly worse for the Vocational and
much worse for the Technical level. Consequently,
the model seems to miss many Technical proﬁles,
confusing them with the other educational tracks.
The confusion matrix (Table 3) shows that most
(64%) misclassiﬁed Technical proﬁles were incor-
rectly labeled as the more theory-oriented General
track, rather than as the more practice-oriented Vo-
cational track (36%).
As Table 5 summarizes, the model strongly out-
performs a probabilistic baseline (0.34) in cross-
validation, as well as a simple bag-of-words model
(which only uses token unigrams as features) with-
out any parameter tuning, scaling or feature se-
lection (F-score = 0.22). However, when param-
eter tuning, scaling and feature selection are in-
troduced, the BoW-model obtains almost identi-
cal scores in cross-validation:
it yields an over-
all precision, recall and F-score of 0.67 (std. dev.
0.03). There is, however, a difference in how
well both models generalize to unseen data. While

the ﬁrst model reaches an average F-score of 0.60
(see Table 4 for the detailed classiﬁcation report),
the BoW-model achieves a lower score of 0.55,
and particularly underperforms in the detection of
Technical proﬁles, with an F-score of 0.38 (vs 0.50
for the full model).
In order to better understand the differences and
similarities between both models, we compared
their feature sets (after feature selection was ap-
plied) and inspected the 1000 most informative
ones, using information gain as ranking criterion.
While we expected that the most informative fea-
tures for the BoW-model would be lexical and
the ones for the full model stylistic, this anal-
ysis suggests that in both models, many of the
most informative selected features are speciﬁc oc-
currences of chatspeak markers. For the BoW-
model, which uses only token unigrams as fea-
tures, many of the most informative tokens con-
tain one or more chatspeak features (e.g. collo-
quial register, a spelling manipulation, an emoti-
con, character repetition, etc.). Some other infor-
mative tokens seem to be more content- than style-
related, revealing topics such as hobbies, speciﬁc
locations, friends and school. Strikingly, although
the full model contains abstraction of chatspeak
phenomena (e.g. total count for emoticons), spe-
ciﬁc occurrences of these genre markers are still
most informative. The 1000 most informative fea-
tures are all character n-grams: only some reveal
topics (e.g. school), but many more indicate the
use of chatspeak features, and particularly com-
binations of emoji/emoticons. Other n-grams in-
dicate the use of English and Arabic words, of
colloquial terms, of chatspeak spelling, abbrevi-
ations and character repetition. As opposed to the
BoW-model’s token unigrams, these character n-
grams allow the model to capture stylistic features
on a sub-token level (e.g.
the n-gram ‘sss’ cap-
tures repetition of the letter ‘s’ in different words).
We can illustrate a clear advantage by the Arabic
word ‘wallah’ (meaning ‘I swear on God’s name’),
which is often used by our participants with Ara-

bic roots, who spell it in many different ways. Be-
cause of these alternative spellings, ‘wallah’ does
not appear among the most informative tokens in
the BoW-model. However, for the full model, sev-
eral related character n-grams (e.g. ‘wlh’, ‘wll’)
do.
Next, we compared the full model to a stylistic
model using only chatspeak features (both abstrac-
tions and speciﬁc occurrences), and no token or
character n-grams. This stylistic model performs
slightly worse on both the training set (F-score =
0.64, std. dev. 0.04) and unseen data (F-score
= 0.59) (see Table 5). However, inspection of
the most informative features in this feature set
provides further insight in the education proﬁling
task. Many of the most informative features are
again speciﬁc occurrences of stylistic phenomena
(e.g. speciﬁc emoticons, speciﬁc lexemes contain-
ing letter repetition). Some abstract representa-
tions of online writing style characteristics appear
among the top-1000 features too (such as the to-
tal use of character repetition, of onomatopoeic
laughter, acronyms, English words, mentions and
hashtags, and emoticons), but much less promi-
nently. These ﬁndings suggest that even in a
purely stylistic model, abstract representation of
certain style features is not informative enough for
education proﬁling, and appears to be less impor-
tant than the use of these features within speciﬁc
tokens or contexts.

5.2 Additional Experiments

Additional experiments indicate that the task be-
comes much easier when the hybrid Technical Ed-
ucation level is not included. Performance for
this binary classiﬁcation task (distinguishing be-
tween General and Vocational students only) is
much higher (F-score = 0.81 with std. dev. 0.04 in
cross-validation, and 0.78 on unseen data; see Ta-
bles 6 and 7 for the classiﬁcation reports), showing
that Vocational and General students are not often
linguistically confused by the model. Strikingly,
in this setting, the purely stylistic model performs
similarly on the training data (F-score = 0.81, std.
dev. 0.08), and even better on the unseen data (F-
score = 0.82) than the full model. This suggests
that stylistic differences are more outspoken and
consistent between General and Vocational stu-
dents, and might be sufﬁcient for classiﬁcation.
Finally, ﬁrst experiments with separate classiﬁers
for girls and for boys, and for younger versus older
teenagers, suggest interesting distinctions (see Ta-
ble 8). It appears to be easier to correctly predict
educational track for girls (F-score = 0.67 with
std. dev. 0.07 in cross-validation; and 0.69 on un-
seen data) than for boys (F-score = 0.60 with std.
dev. 0.09 in cross-validation; and 0.66 on unseen
data). This suggests that more education-based
linguistic variation can be found among girls than
among boys. Similarly, better predictions could be
made on unseen data for older teenagers, aged 17-
20 (F-score = 0.62 in cross-validation, std. dev.
0.07; and 0.63 on unseen data), than for younger

adolescents, aged 13-16 (F-score = 0.69 in cross-
validation, std. dev. 0.09; and 0.55 on unseen
data). This might be due to the fact that the older
teenagers have been together in the same peer net-
works and class groups for a longer time, and
might write more similarly on social media. Fur-
thermore, some of the younger students might ac-
tually still change educational track.

6 Conclusion

We conducted classiﬁcation experiments to pre-
dict educational track for Flemish adolescents,
based on their social media writing. These ﬁrst
results are promising and indicate that the task
is doable. However, although the best model
strongly outperforms a probabilistic baseline, its
performance is similar to that of a simple BoW-
model. This might give the impression that lexi-
cal features are still very important; however, in-
spection of the most informative features revealed
that many of the most informative tokens con-
tain stylistic features typical of the informal online
genre. The most informative features for the full
model suggest that abstraction of these stylistic
chatspeak features (or at least, the current imple-
mentation) is still of lesser importance than spe-
ciﬁc occurrences.
While the distinction between General and Voca-
tional high school students appears to be relatively
easy to make, the detection of students in the in-
termediate Technical track is much harder. This
could indicate that these students are truly a hybrid
class with subsets of students that are simply not
that different from their peers in more theory- or
more practice-oriented tracks, respectively. In ad-
dition, related research shows that these students’
online writing is rather unpredictable and does not
follow a clear pattern (Hilte et al., 2018a,b).
In future work, we want to experiment with addi-
tional algorithms, such as ensemble methods, and
with a post-level rather than a participant-level ap-
proach (in order to have more data samples at our

disposal). We also want to improve the current
feature design and particularly the abstract repre-
sentation of style features, because as van der Goot
et al. (2018) write, abstract features may increase
generalizability to other corpora (and even gen-
res and languages) in author proﬁling tasks, com-
pared to lexical models. Finally, we want to fur-
ther investigate the creation of different classiﬁers
for different subgroups of participants (e.g. boys
versus girls).
Finally, we stress that this proﬁling task is not only
relevant in a Belgian context, since the educational
tracks serving as class labels correspond to several
countries’ secondary education programs. Fur-
thermore, the inclusion of stylistic features - i.e.
chatspeak phenomena occurring in any language
- adds to this generalizability. While speciﬁc lex-
emes or speciﬁc realizations of chatspeak mark-
ers may not always be relevant in other languages
or corpora, the abstract stylistic features are more
universal on social media. We argue that these
models for education proﬁling, when further im-
proved, could be used in different languages and
applications. For instance, the addition of an edu-
cational compound can increase existing proﬁling
tools’ performance, which can be important in dif-
ferent tasks (e.g. the detection of fake accounts on
social media, and many more).

7 Supplementary Materials
Because of the decision of our university’s ethical
committee, in line with European regulations to
ensure the adolescents’ privacy, we cannot make
the dataset publicly available. The code will be
made available.
