Abstract

Misinformation detection at the level of full
news articles is a text classiﬁcation problem.
Reliably labeled data in this domain is rare.
Previous work relied on news articles collected
from so-called “reputable” and “suspicious”
websites and labeled accordingly. We leverage
fact-checking websites to collect individually-
labeled news articles with regard to the verac-
ity of their content and use this data to test
the cross-domain generalization of a classiﬁer
trained on bigger text collections but labeled
according to source reputation. Our results
suggest that reputation-based classiﬁcation is
not sufﬁcient for predicting the veracity level
of the majority of news articles, and that the
system performance on different test datasets
depends on topic distribution. Therefore col-
lecting well-balanced and carefully-assessed
training data is a priority for developing robust
misinformation detection systems.
Introduction

1
Automatic detection of fake from legitimate news
in different formats such as headlines, tweets and
full news articles has been approached in recent
Natural Language Processing literature (Vlachos
and Riedel, 2014; Vosoughi, 2015; Jin et al., 2016;
Rashkin et al., 2017; Volkova et al., 2017; Wang,
2017; Pomerleau and Rao, 2017; Thorne et al.,
2018). The most important challenge in automatic
misinformation detection using modern NLP tech-
niques, especially at the level of full news arti-
cles, is data. Most previous systems built to iden-
tify fake news articles rely on training data la-
beled with respect to the general reputation of the
sources, i.e., domains/user accounts (Fogg et al.,
2001; Lazer et al., 2017; Rashkin et al., 2017).
Even though some of these studies try to identify
fake news based on linguistic cues, the question
is whether they learn publishers’ general writ-
ing style (e.g., common writing features of a few

clickbaity websites) or deceptive style (similari-
ties among news articles that contain misinforma-
tion).

In this study, we collect two new datasets that
include the full text of news articles and individ-
ually assigned veracity labels. We then address
the above question, by conducting a set of cross-
domain experiments: training a text classiﬁcation
system on data collected in a batch manner from
suspicious and reputable websites and then test-
ing the system on news articles that have been as-
sessed in a one-by-one fashion. Our experiments
reveal that the generalization power of a model
trained on reputation-based labeled data is not im-
pressive on individually assessed articles. There-
fore, we propose to collect and verify larger col-
lections of news articles with reliably assigned la-
bels that would be useful for building more robust
fake news detection systems.

2 Data Collection

Most studies on fake news detection have exam-
ined microblogs, headlines and claims in the form
of short statements. A few recent studies have ex-
amined full articles (i.e., actual ‘fake news’) to ex-
tract discriminative linguistic features of misinfor-
mation (Yang et al., 2017; Rashkin et al., 2017;
Horne and Adali, 2017). The issue with these stud-
ies is the data collection methodology. Texts are
harvested from websites that are assumed to be
fake news publishers (according to a list of sus-
picious websites), with no individual labeling of
data. The so-called suspicious sources, however,
sometimes do publish facts and valid information,
and reputable websites sometimes publish inaccu-
rate information (Mantzarlis, 2017). The key to
collect more reliable data, then, is to not rely on
the source but on the text of the article itself, and
only after the text has been assessed by human

mation. Currently, there exists only small col-
lections of reliably-labeled news articles (Rubin
et al., 2016; Allcott and Gentzkow, 2017; Zhang
et al., 2018; Baly et al., 2018) because this type of
annotation is laborious. The Liar dataset (Wang,
2017) is the ﬁrst large dataset collected through re-
liable annotation, but it contains only short state-
ments. Another recently published large dataset
is FEVER (Thorne et al., 2018), which contains
both claims and texts from Wikipedia pages that
support or refute those claims. This dataset, how-
ever, has been built to serve the slightly different
purpose of stance detection (Pomerleau and Rao,
2017; Mohtarami et al., 2018), the claims have
been artiﬁcially generated, and texts are not news
articles.

Our objective is to elaborate on the distinc-
tion between classifying reputation-based la-
beled news articles and individually-assessed
news articles. We do so by collecting and using
datasets of the second type in evaluation of a text
classiﬁer trained on the ﬁrst type of data. In this
section, we ﬁrst introduce one large collection of
news text from previous studies that has been la-
beled according to the list of suspicious websites,
and one small collection that was labeled manu-
ally for each and every news article, but only con-
tains satirical and legitimate instances. We then
introduce two datasets that we have scraped from
the web by leveraging links to news articles men-
tioned by fact-checking websites (Buzzfeed and
Snopes). The distinguishing feature of these new
collections is that they contain not only the full
text of real news articles found online, but also
individually assigned veracity labels indicative of
their misinformative content.

Rashkin et al. dataset: Rashkin et al.
(2017)
published a collection of roughly 20k news ar-
ticles from eight sources categorized into four
classes: propaganda (The Natural News and Ac-
tivist Report), satire (The Onion, The Borowitz
Report, and Clickhole), hoax (American News
and DC Gazette) and trusted (Gigaword News).
This dataset is balanced across classes, and since
the articles in their training and test splits come
from different websites, the accuracy of the trained
model on test data should be demonstrative of its
understanding of the general writing style of each
target class rather than author-speciﬁc cues. How-
ever, we suspect that the noisy strategy to label

all articles of a publisher based on its reputation
highly biases the classiﬁer decisions and limits
its power to distinguish individual misinformative
from truthful news articles.
Rubin et al. dataset: As part of a study on satir-
ical cues, Rubin et al. (2016) published a dataset of
360 news articles. This dataset contains balanced
numbers of individually evaluated satirical and le-
gitimate texts. Even though small, it is a clean
data to test the generalization power of a system
trained on noisy data such as the above explained
dataset. We use this data to make our point about
the need for careful annotation of news articles on
a one-by-one fashion, rather than harvesting from
websites generally knows as hoax, propaganda or
satire publishers.
BuzzfeedUSE dataset: The ﬁrst source of in-
formation that we used to harvest full news arti-
cles with veracity labels is from the Buzzfeed fact-
checking company. Buzzfeed has published a col-
lection of links to Facebook posts, originally com-
piled for a study around the 2016 US election (Sil-
verman et al., 2016). Each URL in this dataset was
given to human experts so they can rate the amount
of false information contained in the linked arti-
cle. The links were collected from nine Facebook
pages (three right-wing, three left-wing and three
mainstream publishers).1 We had to follow the
facebook URLs and then the link to the original
news articles to obtain the news texts. We scraped
the full text of each news article from its original
source. The resulting dataset includes a total of
1,380 news articles on a focused topic (US elec-
tion and candidates). Veracity labels come in a 4-
way classiﬁcation scheme including 1,090 mostly
true, 170 mixture of true and false, 64 mostly false
and 56 articles containing no factual content.
Snopes312 dataset: The second source of infor-
mation that we used to harvest full news articles
with veracity labels is Snopes, a well-known ru-
mor debunking website run by a team of expert
editors. We scraped the entire archive of fact-
checking pages. On each page they talk about a
claim, cite the sources (news articles, forums or
social networks where the claim was distributed)
and provide a veracity label for the claim. We
automatically extracted all links mentioned on a
Snopes page, followed the link to each original

news article, and extracted the text. The resulting
dataﬁle includes roughly 4,000 rows, each con-
taining a claim discussed by Snopes annotators,
the veracity label assigned to it, and the text of a
news article related to the claim. The main chal-
lenge in using this data for training/testing a fake
news detector is that some of the links on a Snopes
page that we collect automatically do not actually
point to the discussed news article, i.e., the source
of the claim. Many links are to pages that pro-
vide contextual information for the fact-checking
of the claim. Therefore, not all the texts in our
automatically extracted dataset are reliable or sim-
ply the “supporting” source of the claim. To come
up with a reliable set of veracity-labeled news arti-
cles, we randomly selected 312 items and assessed
them manually. Two annotators performed inde-
pendent assessments on the 312 items. A third an-
notator went through the entire list of items for a
ﬁnal check and resolving disagreements. Snopes
has a ﬁne-grained veracity labeling system. We
selected [fully] true, mostly true, mixture of true
and false, mostly false, and [fully] false stories.
Table 1 shows the distribution of these labels in
the manually assessed 312 items, and how many
from each category of news articles were veri-
ﬁed to be the “supporting” source (distributing
the discussed claim), “context” (providing back-
ground or related information about the topic of
the claim), “debunking” (against the claim), “irrel-
evant” (completely unrelated to the claim or dis-
torted text) and ambiguous (not sure how it related

to the claim). Table 2 provides information on the
confusing choices: About 50% of the items re-
ceived different category labels from the two ﬁrst
annotators. The ﬁrst annotator had a more conser-
vative bias, trying to avoid mistakes in the “sup-
porting” category, whereas the second annotator
often assigned either “supporting” or “context”,
and rarely “irrelevant”. For the disagreed items,
the third annotator (who had access to all outputs)
chose the ﬁnal category. Results in Table 1 are
based on this ﬁnal assessment. We use the “sup-
porting” portion of the data (145 items) in the fol-
lowing experiments.

3 Experiments

In text classiﬁcation, Convolutional Neural Net-
works (CNNs) have been competing with the TF-
IDF model, a simple but strong baseline using
scored n-grams (Le and Mikolov, 2014; Zhang
et al., 2015; Conneau et al., 2017; Medvedeva
et al., 2017). These methods have been used for
fake news detection in previous work (Rashkin
et al., 2017; Wang, 2017). For our experiments, we
trained and tuned different architectures of CNN
and several classic classiﬁers (Naive Bayes and
Support Vector Machines) with TF-IDF features
on Rashkin et al.’s dataset. The best results on the
development data were obtained from a Support
Vector Machine (SVM) classiﬁer using unigram
TF-IDF features with L2 regularization.2 There-

paper. However,

fore, we use this model to demonstrate how a clas-
siﬁer trained on data labeled according to pub-
lisher’s reputation would identify misinformative
news articles.

It is evident in the ﬁrst section of Figure 1, that
the model performs well on similarly collected test
items, i.e., Hoax, Satire, Propaganda and Trusted
news articles within Rashkin et al.’s test dataset.
However, when the model is applied to Rubin et
al.’s data, which was carefully assessed for satiri-
cal cues in each and every article, the performance
drops considerably (See the second section of the
ﬁgure). Although the classiﬁer detects more of
the satirical texts in Rubin et al.’s data, the dis-
tribution of the given labels is not very different to
that of legitimate texts. One important feature of
Rubin et al.’s data is that topics of the legitimate
instances were matched and balanced with topics
of the satirical instances. The results here suggest
that similarities captured by the classiﬁer can be
very dependent on the topics of the news articles.
Next we examine the same model on our col-
lected datasets, BuzzfeedUSE and Snopes312, as
test material. The BuzzfeedUSE data comes with
4 categories (Figure 1). The classiﬁer does seem
to have some sensitivity to true vs.
false infor-
mation in this dataset, as more of the mostly true
articles were labeled as Trusted. The difference
with mostly false articles, however, is negligible.
The most frequent label assigned by the classi-
ﬁer was Hoax in all four categories, which sug-
gests that most BuzzfeedUSE articles looked like
Hoax in Rashkin’s data. Finally, the last section
of 1 shows the results on the Snopes312 plotted
ﬁer was signiﬁcantly better on both dev and test sets:
0.96 and 0.75 F1-score, respectively, compared to 0.91
and 0.65 reported in their paper.

along the 6-category distinction. A stronger corre-
lation can be observed between the classiﬁer deci-
sions and the veracity labels in this data compared
to BuzzfeedUSE. This suggests that distinguishing
between news articles with true and false informa-
tion is a more difﬁcult task when topics are the
same (BuzzfeedUSE data is all related to the US
election). In Snopes312, news articles come from
a variety of topics. The strong alignment between
the classiﬁer’s Propaganda and Hoax labels with
the mostly false and [fully] false categories in this
dataset reveals that most misinformative news ar-
ticles indeed discuss the topics or use the language
of generally suspicious publishers. This is an en-
couraging result in the sense that, with surface fea-
tures such as n-grams and approximate reputation-
based training data, we already can detect some of
the misinformative news articles. Observing clas-
siﬁcation errors across these experiments, how-
ever, indicates that the model performance varies a
lot with the type of test material: In a focused topic
situation, it fails to distinguish between categories
(false vs.
legitimate arti-
cles). While a correlation is consistently observed
between labels assigned by the classiﬁer and the
actual labels of target news articles,3 reputation-
based classiﬁcation does not seem to be sufﬁcient
for predicting the veracity level of the majority of
news articles.

4 Conclusion

We found that collecting reliable data for auto-
matic misinformation detection at the level of full
news articles is a challenging but necessary task
for building robust models. If we want to beneﬁt

such as CNNs, we require larger datasets than
what is currently available. We took the ﬁrst steps,
by scraping claims and veracity labels from fact-
checking websites, extracting and cleaning of the
original news articles’ texts (resulting in roughly
4,000 items), and ﬁnally manual assessment of a
subset of the data to provide reliable test mate-
rial for misinformation detection. Our future plan
is to crowd-source annotators for the remaining
scraped texts and publish a large set of labeled
news articles for training purposes.
