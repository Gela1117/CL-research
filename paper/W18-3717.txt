Pronounceability 

computer-assisted 

This study assesses an index for measuring 
the  pronunciation  difficulty  of  sentences 
(henceforth,  pronounceability)  based  on 
the normalized edit distance from a refer-
ence  sentence  to  a  transcription  of  learn-
ers‚Äô 
should be examined when language teach-
ers 
learning system for pronunciation learning 
to  maintain  the  motivation  of  learners. 
However, unlike the evaluation of learners‚Äô 
pronunciation  performance,  previous  re-
search  did  not  focus  on  pronounceability 
not  only  for  English  but  also  for  Asian 
languages.  This  study  found  that  the  nor-
malized edit distance  was  reliable but not 
valid. The lack of validity appeared to be 
because of an English test  used  for deter-
mining the proficiency of learners. 

1  Introduction 

Research on computer-assisted language learning 
(CALL) has been carried out for learning the pro-
nunciation  of  European  languages  as  a  foreign 
language  such  as  English  (Witt  &  Young  2002, 
Mak  et  al.  2004,  Ai  &  Xu  2015,  Liu  &  Hung 
2016)  and  Swedish  (Koniaris  2014).  CALL  re-
search  on  Asian  languages  has  considered  Japa-
nese  as  a  foreign  language  (Hirata  2004)  and 
Chinese as a foreign language (Zhao et al. 2012). 
The primary goal of CALL systems for the learn-
ing  of  foreign  language  pronunciation  is  to  re-
solve  interference  from  the  first  language  of 
learners.  For  instance,  a  CALL  system  can  ana-
lyze the speech in which a learner reads English 
sentences aloud and presents pronunciation errors 
that a learner must read aloud again for reducing 
the errors. 

Even  though  the  methods  of  evaluating  learn-
ers‚Äô  pronunciation  performance  have  received 
considerable  attention  in  previous  research,  the 
pronunciation  difficulty of sentences  (henceforth,

pronounceability)  has  not  been  examined  exten-
sively. Given that readability and the difficulty of 
listening  influence  learners‚Äô  motivation  and  out-
comes (Hwang 2005, Lai 2015, Yoon et al. 2016), 
we consider that CALL for pronunciation learning 
should  consider  pronounceability  in  evaluating 
learners‚Äô pronunciation. 

Pronounceability  can  be  represented  as  the 

phonetic  edit  distance  from  reference  pronuncia-
tion  to  a  learner‚Äôs  expected  pronunciation  based 
on  the  proficiency.  Phonetic  edit  distance  can  be 
measured  using  a  modified  version  of  the  Le-
venshtein edit distance (Wieling et al. 2014) or a 
deep-neural-network-based  classifier  (Li  et  al. 
2016). 

This  study  measured  normalized  edit  distance 

(NED)  using  the  orthographical  transcription  of 
learners‚Äô pronunciation of reference sentences. An 
advantage of the NED based on orthographic tran-
scription is the availability of data. This is because 
language teachers can obtain orthographical tran-
scription without being trained for phonetic tran-
scription. 

This  study  measures  pronounceability  using 

multiple  regression  analysis  considering  ortho-
graphic NED as a dependent variable and the fea-
tures  of  a  sentence  and  a  learner  as  independent 
variables.  First,  a  corpus  for  multiple  regression 
analysis is developed. This corpus includes the da-
ta  for  NED  and  the  proficiency  data  in  a  score-
based  scale  of  Test  of  English  for  International 
Communication  (TOEIC).  TOEIC  is  a  widely 
used  English  test  in  Asian  countries,  and  its  test 
score ranges from 10 to 990. In previous research 
(Grahma et al. 2015, Delais-Roussarie 2015, G√≥sy 
et al. 2015), proficiency was demonstrated using a 
point-scale 
the 
Framework of Reference for Languages (six lev-
els from A1 to C2).

Our phonetic learner corpus was compiled by re-
cording  pronunciation  data  for  English  texts  that 
learners read aloud sentence by sentence. In addi-
tion, after reading a sentence aloud, learners sub-
jectively determined the pronounceability of sen-
tences  on  a  five-point  Likert  scale  (1:  easy
somewhat easy
5: difficult) (henceforth, SBJ). 

(International 

The texts for reading aloud (the title of Text I is 
the North Wind and the Sun and that of Text II is 
the Boy who Cried Wolf) were selected from the 
texts distributed by the International Phonetic As-
sociation 
Association 
Phonetic 
1999).  Even  though  these  texts  contain  only  15 
sentences, they cover the basic sounds of English 
(International Phonetic Association 1999, Deterd-
ing 2006). This enables us to analyze which types 
of  English  sounds  influence  learners‚Äô  pronuncia-
tion. Deterding (2006) reported that Text I failed 
to cover certain sounds, such as initial and medial 
/z/ and syllable-initial /Œ∏/, and then developed ma-
terial  that  covered  the  English  pronunciation  for 
these sounds by rewriting a well-known fable by 
Aesop (Text II). 

The corpus data were compiled from 50 learn-
ers of English as a foreign language at university 
(28  males,  22  females;  mean  age:  20.8  years 
(standard deviation, SD, 1.3)). The learners were 
compensated for their participation. In our sample, 
the  mean  TOEIC  score  was  607.7  (SD,  186.2). 
The minimum and maximum scores were 295 and 
900, respectively. 

 

2.2  Annotation of Pronunciation Data 

Our  phonetic  learner  corpus  includes  NED,  the 
linguistic  features  of  sentences,  and  learner  fea-
tures.  

NED  was  derived  as  the Levenshtein  edit  dis-

tance  normalized  by  sentence  length.  It  reflected 
the differences from the reference sentences to the 
transcription of learners‚Äô pronunciation due to the 
substitution,  deletion,  or  insertion  of  letters.  Be-
fore measuring the edit distance, symbols such as 
commas and periods were deleted and expressions 
were  uncapitalized  in  the transcription  and  refer-
ence data. 

The pronunciation was manually transcribed by 
a transcriber who was a native speaker of English 
and  trained  to  replicate  interviews  and  meetings 
but  was  unaccustomed  to  the  English  spoken  by 
learners. The transcriber examined the texts before 
starting the transcription task. The transcriber was 
required to replicate learners‚Äô pronunciation with-
out adding, deleting, and substituting any expres-
sions for improving grammaticality and/or accept-
ability  (except  the  addition  of  symbols  such  as 
commas and periods). 

Linguistic  features  were  automatically  derived 
from  a  sentence  as  follows:  Sentence length  was 
derived  as  the  number  of  words  in  a  sentence. 
Word length was derived as the number of sylla-
bles  in  a  word.  The  number  of  multiple-syllable 
words  in  a  sentence  were  derived  by  calculating 
‚àë (ùëÜ(cid:3036)‚àí 1)(cid:3015)
, where 
(cid:3036)(cid:2880)(cid:2869)
in a sentence, and 
in the 
inated the presence of single-syllable words. Word 
difficulty  was  derived  as  the  rate  of  words  not 
listed in a basic vocabulary list (Kiyokawa 1990) 
relative to the total number of words in a sentence. 
Table 1  summarizes  the linguistic  features  of the 
texts that learners read aloud, i.e., text length and

Even  though  TOEIC  consists  of  listening  and

established  direct  assessment  of  oral  language

stitute of the U.S. Department of State (Chauncey 
Group International 1998).  

3  Properties  of  Phonetic  Learner  Cor-

pus 

Our  phonetic  learner  corpus  was  compiled  using 
the method described in Section 2, and this corpus 
included  750  instances  (15  sentences  read  aloud 
by 50 learners). Table 2 shows the descriptive sta-
tistics  for  NED  and  SBJ  in  the  phonetic  learner 
corpus. 

In Sections 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3, research questions 1‚Äì
3  are  assessed  using  the  classical  test  theory 
(Brown 1996). The fourth question is answered in 
Section 4.4. 

4.1  Reliability of NED 

The reliability of NED was examined through in-
ternal  consistency  in  terms  of  Cronbach‚Äôs 
(Cronbach  1970).  Internal  consistency  refers  to 
whether NED demonstrates similar results for sen-
tences  with  similar  pronounceability.  Cronbach‚Äôs 
Œ±  is a reliability coefficient defined by the follow-

ing  equation:

bility), and empirical satisfaction is achieved with 
values above 0.8. 

As reliability depends on the number of items, 

the  reliability  coefficients  were  derived  individu-
ally  for  each  text  (Text  I  containing  5  sentences 
and  Text  II  containing  10  sentences)  and  jointly 
for both texts. The reliability coefficients of NED 
and SBJ are shown in Table 3.

The reliability coefficient of NED exceeded the 

value required for empirical satisfaction (
in Text II and Texts I & II. Hence, NED is partial-
ly reliable as a pronounceability index. However, 
NED  demonstrated  lower  reliability  compared  to 
SBJ. This suggests that NED should be improved 
through modification.

5  Conclusion 

4.2  Construct Validity of NED 

Construct  validity  was  examined  from  the 

viewpoint of distinctiveness. If NED appropriately 
reflects learners‚Äô proficiency, NED should demon-
strate  a  statistically  significant  difference  (
0.01) among learners at different proficiency lev-
els. Our phonetic learner corpus data were classi-
fied into three levels based on the TOEIC scores 
below 490 (beginner level) (
(intermediate level)  (
(advanced level) (

and SBJ for the three levels. The distinctiveness of 
NED  was  investigated  using  ANOVA.  ANOVA

4.3  Criterion-related Validity of NED 

Criterion-related  validity  was  examined  from  the 
viewpoint  of  the  correlation  with  learners‚Äô  profi-
ciency in terms of TOEIC scores. NED should re-
flect learners‚Äô proficiency because pronounceabil-
ity should depend on learners‚Äô proficiency. Then, 
the  correlation  between  NED  and  TOEIC  scores 
and  between  SBJ  and  TOEIC  scores  was  exam-
ined.

Owing to this, NED failed to demonstrate criteri-
on-related  validity  depending  on  TOEIC-based

4.4  Pronounceability Measurement 

Pronounceability  was  measured  through  multiple 
regression analysis. NED was the dependent vari-
able,  and  the  linguistic  and  learner  features  de-
scribed  in  Section  2  were  the  independent  varia-
bles.  However,  multiple-syllable  words  were  not 
used owing to the variance inflation factor (
12.3) (Kutner et al. 2002). A significant regression 

This  study  assessed  whether  NED  appropriately 
demonstrated  pronounceability  for  learning  the 
pronunciation  of  English  as  a  foreign  language. 
The  assessment  suggests  that  NED  is  reliable 
(Section 4.1) but not valid (Sections 4.2 and 4.3). 
The 
pronounceability 
(Section 4.4) suggest that NED was appropriately 
explained by the word difficulty.
