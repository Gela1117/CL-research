the many items 
on eBay?

Browse Pages

Idea: 
Create permanent “browse” pages for all items & 
products within a category that share a certain set 
of name-value pairs, e.g. 
•
• ”Wattage” = “9W”
• ”Bulb Shape Code” = “E27”

In category “Light Bulbs”

Users can then navigate to
• Related/refined browse pages
• Hot offers
• Individual products

=> Also beneficial for Search Engines

Proceedings for AMTA 2018 Workshop: Translation Quality Estimation and Automatic Post-EditingBoston, March 21, 2018   |   Page 9eBay is present 
• in dozens of countries
• with thousands of categories
• with hundreds of thousands of name-value pairs 

(products aspects aka slots)

àMillions of potential browse pages (and titles) 

required!

Why automatic 
title generation?

Browse Pages

Proceedings for AMTA 2018 Workshop: Translation Quality Estimation and Automatic Post-EditingBoston, March 21, 2018   |   Page 10First approach we implemented for German: 
Rule-based approach
1. Use hand-written heuristics / shallow parsers to 

classify each slot

2. Order slots based on slot classes
3. Realize each slot separately based on slot class

• Use dedicated heuristics for certain 

combinations, e.g. Category + Product Type

4. Concatenate realizations

Step 1:              
rule-based title 
generation

Proceedings for AMTA 2018 Workshop: Translation Quality Estimation and Automatic Post-EditingBoston, March 21, 2018   |   Page 11Step 2:               
APE

Browse Pages

For German, we have
• Millions of browse page titles in a slightly 

artificial language 
(our output from rule-based system)

• Parallel titles in a “natural” language (human 

curated titles)

=> train an APE system on those

e.g. translate 
KaukasischeWohnraum-TeppichefürPatchwork
into
KaukasischeWohnraum-TeppichemitPatchwork-
Muster

Pros & Cons

Browse Pages

Pro
+ Straight forward
+ Large improvements in quality 
+ Easy to integrate

Con
(cid:1) Can only fix data that’s there (can’t reconstruct 

missing slots, slot names or context, …)

(cid:1) Sometimes learns artifacts from data (esp. when 

(cid:1) Will learn curation rules present when titles were 

noisy)

Estimation

Learning algorithms

Extremely Randomized Trees
• Ensemble of decision trees
• Random forests

• Build on random samples from training data
• Choose best split for random subset of features

• Extremely randomized: additionally choose best threshold from

random set of thresholds

AdaBoost
• Sequence of weak learners (very small decision trees)
• Fit them on original dataset
• Then fit additional copies of classifier on same data, but adjust weights

of incorrectly classified instances s.t. subsequent classifiers focus
more on difficult cases

• Final prediction: weighted majority vote of all iterations
• Time consuming

Both:
• Non-linear
• Provides feature importances

Experimental setup

•
• HTER labels clipped in [0, 1]
• 75/25 train/test splits
• Model selection

• Randomized search with 5-fold cross 

validation (100 iterations)

• Optimized for mean absolute error

• Evaluation

• mean absolute error (MAE) ê
• Pearson‘s correlation é

• Fewer named entities than other 2 categories
• More generic description of items
Þ NER not very helpful
• Many bad translations

• Quality prediction in the tails of the test set distribution is 

problematic

• Tails equals to

• Good translations (HTER close to 0)
• Bad translations (HTER close to 1)

Conclusion
• Best feature set on average: Quest79 + NER
• AdaBoost presents the best accuracy, but slow
• Extremely Randomized Trees offer best trade-off 

between accuracy and computing time

• Models can predict bad and good translations 

with more than 50% accuracy

• Models for single categories, no pooling
