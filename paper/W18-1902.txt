MATERIAL Goal

• Revolutionize multilingual triage by enabling rapid 

development of language-independent methods (when 
possible) to field systems capable of fulfilling domain-specific 
cross-language information retrieval tasks over both text and 
speech data, with:

– Limited bitext and transcribed speech training data
– English domain-specific queries as input
– English summaries of retrieved results as output
– Methods for domain adaptation and portability to new languages
– Assessment of the technology via a resonating end-to-end use case

The MATERIAL System

• An “English-in, English-out” information retrieval system that, 
given a domain-sensitive English query, will retrieve relevant 
data from a large multilingual repository and display the 
retrieved information in English as summaries that reflect the 
document relevance:

• Fundamental Challenges

Military convoy

Lack of bitexts or commercial products to exploit
Incomplete grammatical descriptions

•
•
• Scant lexical resources
• May have radically divergent typologies and complex morphologies
• May have encoding anomalies
• Segmentation issues
•
•

Lack of orthographic standardization; Multiple scripts
Informal genres of text will capture orthographic deviation (typos vs. truncations)

• Address domain-restricted information need

“polio vaccine”
Domain: Government and Politics

Subject Domain

…In response, the Armenian Ministry of Health urged all Syrian 
Armenians under age 15 to get the polio vaccination…

…Severe adverse reactions to this vaccine are rare.…

…The oral vaccine was made by weakening the three strains of 
poliovirus that caused disease by growing them in monkey 
kidney cells…

Key Technical Challenges

– Techniques appropriate for a wide variety of languages
– Performance on formal and informal text and speech in a wide variety 

of genres that do not match the training conditions

– Development of new methods for domain adaptation without 

monolingual or parallel training data in that domain

– Limited time to develop a fully automatic E2E system to process a 

new language

– Inter-language domain mismatches reflecting a cultural component
– Use of web resources to complement limited training data

Performers must develop methods

that are not data intensive.

INTELLIGENCE ADVANCED RESEARCH PROJECTS ACTIVITY (IARPA)

MATERIAL Training Data

• Each language will be provided at kick-off to performers in a “pack” from 
the IARPA T&E Team that will contain training data for MT and ASR as 
well as relevant language information

• Speech data will include:

• Roughly 50 hours of conversational speech transcriptions in a normalized orthography 

in two demographically balanced partitions (40 hours training; 10 hours dev test)

• Phonetic Lexica
• Not all genres and domains will be present in the training data

• MT Training data will include:

• 800K word bitexts in each program language, sentence-aligned. Up to five sentences 

may be included with a denoted grouping. Translations are purely human and new.

• Not all genres and domains will be present in the training data

• Language information will include:

• Description of the language (e.g., dialect regions, phoneme set definitions)
• Basic information on dialects, spelling and encoding

Test Structure Rationale

• T&E regimen designed to drive R&D towards the program goal, viz:

Language independent methods, tools, and technologies to provide 
rapid-deployment of domain-adapted MT for low-resource languages 
effectively integrated in a usable CLIR system

• So:

– Multiple languages with varying characteristics
– Only small amounts of IARPA-furnished bitexts for training
– Domain contextualized queries
– Decreasing lead-time for development & surprise language evaluation

CLIR Detection Metric: AQWV
Actual Query Weighted Value

• All queries are treated equally (regardless of whether they 

generate single or multiple hits).

• Must be able to calibrate the metric against a baseline CLIR 
system that has two inputs: GOTS MT and human translation.
• Metrics will be reported to performers as an average over the 

set of queries (not individually for each query).

• Calculated as a representation of error rate taking into account 

probability of hits, false alarms, and the total number of 
responsive documents.  These parameters will be set by T&E 
once the data are collected and evaluated.

INTELLIGENCE ADVANCED RESEARCH PROJECTS ACTIVITY (IARPA)
INTELLIGENCE ADVANCED RESEARCH PROJECTS ACTIVITY (IARPA)

17

Actual Query Weighted Value (AQWV)
Developers choose Θ, the detection threshold for their 
“Actual Decisions”, to optimize query-weighted value
 V is the a priori value (benefit) of a correct response
 C is the a priori cost of an incorrect response
 Prel is the prior probability that a document is relevant to a query, e.g. 10-3

Developers will tune 
their systems to the 
threshold that 
maximizes the 
AQWV.  Note that 1 
is a perfect score; 
that is, error rate is 
zero.

annotation, partitioning and vetting. They have built a baseline system to 
better understand program challenges and appropriately set expectations.
POCs: Nick Malyska and Jennifer Melot

Agglutinative morphology with reduplication:

will not be covered by the 
very limited amounts of

• Doing well with limited
