Abstract

This paper presents a dataset and super-
vised classiﬁcation approach for economic
event detection in English news articles.
Currently, the economic domain is lack-
ing resources and methods for data-driven
supervised event detection. The detection
task is conceived as a sentence-level clas-
siﬁcation task for 10 different economic
event types. Two different machine learn-
ing approaches were tested: a rich feature
set Support Vector Machine (SVM) set-up
and a word-vector-based long short-term
memory recurrent neural network (RNN-
LSTM) set-up. We show satisfactory re-
sults for most event types, with the linear
kernel SVM outperforming the other ex-
perimental set-ups.

which shareholders of acquired ﬁrms gain better
returns during mergers, or examine the behavior
of companies stock prices around events such as
dividend announcements or stock splits. Study-
ing the impact of speciﬁc events on the stock mar-
kets, however, is a labor-intensive process, start-
ing with the identiﬁcation of a given event, the es-
timation of abnormal returns to separate the gen-
eral movement of stock returns from an individual
stock return, followed by a number of statistical
tests seeking evidence to support the event’s eco-
nomic signiﬁcance. Since identifying news pub-
lished about certain events in an automatic way
enables researchers in the ﬁeld of event studies
to process more data in less time, and can con-
sequently lead to new insights into the correlation
between events and stock market movements, au-
tomatic techniques have been proposed to detect
economic events in text.

Introduction

1
In the ﬁnancial domain,
the way companies
are perceived by investors is inﬂuenced by the
news published about those companies (Engle and
Ng, 1993; Tetlock, 2007; Mian and Sankaragu-
ruswamy, 2012). Tetlock (2007), for example,
tried to characterize the relationship between the
content of media reports and daily stock market
activity, focusing on the immediate inﬂuence of
the Wall Street Journal’s ‘Abreast of the Market’
column on U.S. stock market returns. One of
his major ﬁndings was that high levels of media
pessimism robustly predict downward pressure on
market prices.

To provide some insights into the way mar-
kets react to new information about companies,
ﬁnancial economists have conducted event stud-
ies. These event studies measure the impact of
a speciﬁc event on the value of a ﬁrm (MacKin-
lay, 1997). They offer insight into the extent to

Most of

the existing approaches

to the
detection of economic events, however, are
knowledge-based and pattern-based (Arendarenko
and Kakkonen, 2012; Hogenboom et al., 2013;
Du et al., 2016). These use rule-sets or ontology
knowledge-bases which are largely or fully cre-
ated by hand. The Stock Sonar project (Feldman
et al., 2011) notably uses domain experts to for-
mulate event rules for rule-based stock sentiment
analysis. This technology has been successfully
used in assessing the impact of events on the stock
market (Boudoukh et al., 2016) and in formulating
trading strategies (Ben Ami and Feldman, 2017).
Other approaches conceptualize economic event
detection as the extraction of event tuples (Ding
et al., 2015) or as semantic frame parsing (Xie
et al., 2013).

A drawback of knowledge-based information
extraction methods is that creating rules and on-
tologies is a difﬁcult,
time-consuming process.
Furthermore, deﬁning a set of strict rules often re-

ProceedingsoftheFirstWorkshoponEconomicsandNaturalLanguageProcessing,pages1–10Melbourne,Australia,July20,2018.c(cid:13)2018AssociationforComputationalLinguistics1sults in low recall scores, since these rules usu-
ally cover only a portion of the many various
ways in which certain information can be lexi-
calized. Thus, the need for ﬂexible data-driven
approaches, which do not require predeﬁned on-
tological resources, arises. R¨onnqvist and Sar-
lin (2017) provide an example of successful data-
driven, weakly-supervised distress event detection
based on bank entity mentions. Here, bank distress
events are conceptualized as mentions of bank en-
tities in a time-window and no typology classiﬁ-
cation is assigned. We are not aware of any pub-
lished data-driven, supervised event detection ap-
proaches for the economic domain. However, in
general domain event extraction, as embodied by
projects such as ACE (Ahn, 2006) and ERE/TAC-
KBP (Mitamura et al., 2016), supervised meth-
ods for extraction of event structures are predomi-
nant because of their promise of improved perfor-
mance.

As discussed in Sprugnoli and Tonelli (2017),
the deﬁnition of events in the ﬁeld of informa-
tion extraction differs widely.
In this work, we
employ a conceptualization of economic event de-
tection as ‘retrieving textually reported real-world
occurrences, actions, relations, and situations in-
volving companies and ﬁrms’. Unlike other su-
pervised data-driven ‘event extraction’ tasks such
as in the ACE/ERE programs (Aguilar et al.,
2014), we do not conceptualize events as struc-
tured schemata/frames, but more limited as tex-
tual mentions of real-world occurrences. The task
presented here is often also referred to as event
‘mention’, ‘nugget’, or ‘trigger’ detection. The
classiﬁcation experiments described here are cur-
rently at the sentence-level, but our event annota-
tion scheme is token-level.

In this paper, we tackle the task of economic
event detection by means of a supervised machine
learning approach, which we expect will be able
to detect a wider variety of lexicalizations of eco-
nomic events than pattern-based approaches. We
consider economic event detection as a sentence-
level multi-label classiﬁcation task. The goal is to
automatically assign the presence of a set of pre-
determined economic event categories in a sen-
tence of a news article.

In previous work on the Dutch counterpart of
this dataset, (Lefever and Hoste, 2016) has shown
that SVM classiﬁcation obtained decent results.
Here, we compare two different machine learning

approaches, viz. a rich feature set Support Vec-
tor Machine (SVM) approach, and a word-vector-
based sequence long short-term memory recurrent
neural network (RNN-LSTM) approach. We show
that supervised classiﬁcation is a viable approach
to extract economic events, with the linear ker-
nel SVM obtaining the best classiﬁcation perfor-
mance.

The remainder of this paper is structured as
follows.
In Section 2, we present the annotated
corpus of ﬁnancial news articles we constructed.
Section 3 introduces our two classiﬁcation ap-
proaches to economic event detection, followed
by an overview of the results in Section 4.
In
Section 5, we conduct an error analysis to gain
insights in the main shortcomings of the current
approach. Section 6 formulates some conclusions
and ideas for future work.

2 Data Description

In this section, we describe the SentiFM economic
event dataset collection and annotation. The an-
notated dataset consists of an English and Dutch
news corpus. While in this paper the focus is on
English, we refer to Lefever and Hoste (2016) for a
pilot study on Dutch event detection and a descrip-
tion of the Dutch event data. A reference to where
to download the SentiFM dataset can be found in
Section 7.

The goal of the SentiFM dataset is to enable su-
pervised data-driven event detection in company-
speciﬁc economic news. For English, we down-
loaded articles from the newspaper The Financial
Times using the ProQuest Newsstand by means of
keyword-search. The keywords were manually de-
termined based on a subsample of random articles
as being indicative to one of the event types. All
articles were published between November 2004
and November 2013. The articles had at least
one of the following seven companies in the ti-
tle: Barclays, BHP, Unilever, British Land, Tesco,
Vodafone, and BASF. These companies were se-
lected because they are highly ranked in several
market indexes while situated in different sec-
tors/industries. This facilitates corpus collection
as there is more news content due to the compa-
nies’ status. Sectorial diversiﬁcation is necessary
to avoid specialization to one particular industry.
For instance, six out of 10 highest market cap com-
panies in the S&P500 index currently belong to the
IT sector. In total, we collected 497 news articles

2containing 2522 annotated company-speciﬁc eco-
nomic events.

In the corpus, 10 types of company-speciﬁc

economic events were manually identiﬁed:
Buy ratings A recommendation to purchase the
security from an analyst. As event mentions,
we include rating announcements, forecasts,
performance, buy/sell/hold advice, and rating
upgrades/downgrades/maintained.

Debt Event mentions pertaining to company debt
and debt ratios. We include debt announce-
ments, forecasts, increases, reductions, and
restructuring.

Dividend A dividend is a distribution of a portion
of a company’s earnings paid to its sharehold-
ers. We include dividend announcements,
forecasts, payments, none payments, stable
yields, raises, and reductions.

Merger & acquisition Mergers and acquisitions
refers to the consolidation of companies or
assets involving at least two companies. We
include announcements, forecasts, and can-
cellations of a merger/acquisition.

Proﬁt Financial beneﬁts that are realized when
the amount of revenue exceeds expenses. We
include declarations and forecasts of proﬁt,
positive and negative (losses) proﬁt, lower
than, higher than, as expected, increased, de-
creased, and stable proﬁts.

Quarterly results Events pertaining to the quar-
terly report as a set of ﬁnancial statements is-
sued by a company. We include declaration
of publication, forecasts, strong, weak, im-
proved, declined, stable, better than, worse
than, and as expected results.

Sales volume The quantity of goods and services
sold over a certain period. We include decla-
rations and predictions of sales volumes ﬁg-
ures, increased, decreased, stable, better than,
worse than, as expected sales volumes.

Share repurchase Share buyback events by a
company including announcements and fore-
casts of share repurchases.

Target price Events on the projected price level
of a security. We include announcements,
forecasts, price raised, reduced, or main-
tained.

Turnover The number and frequency of securi-
ties traded over a certain period. We in-
clude declaration and prediction of turnover
ﬁgures, increased, decreased, stable, worse
than, better than, and as expected turnover.

These events and activities pertain to the spe-
ciﬁc instances of companies mentioned in the ar-
ticles. The event typology was manually and it-
eratively constructed on a corpus subsample by
an economic domain specialist. It is notable that
this event typology overlaps largely with the inde-
pendently created StockSonar typology (Feldman
et al., 2011) and SPEED ontology (Hogenboom
et al., 2013). These studies also used a manual and
iterative approach to constructing a descriptive ty-
pology of company-speciﬁc economic events. It is
unsurprising that the event types are highly simi-
lar.

Human annotators marked all mentions of each
of these event types at the token level, using the
Brat rapid annotation tool (Stenetorp et al., 2012),
a web-based tool for text annotation. Events are
linked to the earliest preceding company mentions
with an ‘about company’ relation (this relation
is duplexed into ‘acquiring company’ and ‘tar-
get company’ for Merger & acquisition events).
Discontinuous token spans and annotating multi-
ple event types are allowed. Two annotators were
involved in the ﬁrst pass annotation phase. The
gold standard was subsequently produced by an
adjudication phase. The event annotation guide-
lines for English were ported from Dutch. To as-
sess the reliability of the event annotations, we
measured inter-annotator F1-score on the events
marked by 3 individual annotators in 10 articles
from the Dutch corpus (consisting of 216 sen-
tences and 3,202 tokens). With a cross-averaged
F1-score of 78.41% for the 3 annotator pairs, we
can conclude that the annotated corpus is a reliable
dataset for the task of economic event detection.

All texts were pre-processed (tokenized and
sentence-splitted) using the LeTs Preprocess
Toolkit (Van de Kauter et al., 2013).

The present task is sentence-level detection of
event types, so one sentence instance can be as-
signed multiple event classes. Multiple labels are
assigned to 3.81% (n = 380) of all sentence in-
stances. An overview of the different event types
and their total frequency is given in Table 1.

3 Experimental Set-up

For this study, the task of economic event detec-
tion is conceived as a sentence-level classiﬁcation
task. We decided on comparing two different ma-
chine learning approaches: an SVM approach re-
quiring ofﬂine feature engineering, and a word-
vector-based sequence RNN-LSTM approach.

The SVM approach incorporates a rich feature
set with syntactic and lexical feature engineering.
We built one SVM classiﬁer per event, predicting
whether the event was present in the sentence or
not, in effect recasting the problem as a one-vs-
rest binary classiﬁcation task for each class. The
RNN-LSTM is tested both as a multi-label single
model classiﬁer and a one-vs-rest set-up.

Performance estimation is done on a random
hold-out test split (10%), whereas cross-validation
experiments were carried out on the hold-in set
(train set of 90%) for both hyper-parameter opti-
mization and validation of generalization error.

Per event type, precision, recall, and F1-score
are reported for each approach on the hold-out test

set. We do not report accuracy because it is not
an apt performance indicator in the case of class
imbalance. Cross-validation results on the train-
ing set are not reported due to space constraints,
but followed the same trends as the reported test
results with no indication of over-ﬁtting.

3.1 Support Vector Machines
For the ﬁrst set of experiments, a support vector
machine model was built per economic event type
in a one-vs-rest set-up applying two different ker-
nels: (1) the linear kernel with default LIBSVM
hyperparameters and (2) a hyper-parameter opti-
mized version of the RBF kernel. The optimal
weights for the c and g parameters for the RBF
kernel were obtained by means of a 5-fold grid
search on the training data for each event type. All
experiments were carried out with the LIBSVM
package (Chang and Lin, 2011).

In a ﬁrst step, the data set was linguistically
pre-processed by means of the LeTs Preprocessing
Toolkit (Van de Kauter et al., 2013), which per-
forms lemmatization, part-of-speech tagging, and
named entity recognition. Consequently, a set of
lexical and syntactic features were constructed on
the basis of the pre-processed data.

Lexical features The following lexical features
were constructed:
token n-gram features (uni-
grams, bigrams and trigrams), character n-gram
features (trigrams and fourgrams), lemma n-gram
features (unigrams, bigrams and trigrams), disam-
biguated lemmas (lemma + associated PoS-tag),
and a set of features indicating the presence of nu-
merals, symbols, and time indicators (e.g. yester-
day).

Syntactic features As syntactic features, we ex-
tracted three features for each PoS-category: bi-
nary (presence of category in the instance), ternary
(category occurs 0, 1 or more times in the instance)

In addition, similar features (binary,
ternary, and frequency) were extracted for 6 dif-
ferent Named Entity types: person, organization,
location, product, event, and miscellaneous.

3.2 Recurrent Neural Net LSTM
The RNN-LSTM approach was implemented us-
ing the Keras neural networks API (Chollet et al.,
2015) with TensorFlow as back-end (Abadi et al.,
2015). We employ a straightforward neural ar-
chitecture:
the input-layer is a trainable embed-
ding layer which feeds into an LSTM block. The
LSTM block is connected to an output layer with
a sigmoid activation function. Bi-directionality
of the LSTM-layer is tested in hyper-parameter
optimization. We use the Adam optimization al-
gorithm with binary cross-entropy loss function.
The embedding layer turns positive integers, in
our case hold-in set token indexes, in dense vec-
tors with ﬁxed dimensionality. An existing word
embedding matrix can be used in the input-layer
which tunes pre-trained word vectors.

Three embedded inputs were tested with the
multi-label set-up: 200 dimensional GloVe (Pen-
nington et al., 2014) word vectors trained on the
hold-in set, 300 dimensional GloVe vectors trained
on a 6 billion token corpus of Wikipedia (2014)
+ Gigawords5B1 (henceforth, 6B corpus), and no
pre-trained embeddings. The latter means our
classiﬁer trains embedded word-representations
(with a ﬁxed dimensionality of 200) itself based on
the token sequences of the hold-in set. We evalu-
ated our own GloVe models on an analogy qual-
ity assessment task provided with the word2vec
source code2. We picked the highest dimensional
word vector model from the top ten ranking on
the analogy task. We excluded lower dimensional
vectors because preliminary tests have shown that
higher dimensional pre-trained vectors obtained
better scores.

We ﬁrst tested a multi-label and subsequently
a one-vs-rest approach in which a binary classi-
ﬁer is trained for each economic event class. The
multi-label approach requires one full training iter-
ation compared to one for each of the 10 classes in
one-vs-rest and is much less computationally ex-
pensive. For this reason we limit the tested word-

vector inputs to the 6B GloVe word vectors in the
one-vs-rest approach. These input vectors outper-
formed others in the multi-label experiments con-
sidering F1-score per label, as well as the hold-in
set vectors in preliminary tests using limited itera-
tion randomized search testing.

The following model hyper-parameters were
set by 3-fold random search with 32 itera-
tions. The winning hyper-parameters are chosen
by prevalence-weighted macro-averaged F1-score
over the multi-label prediction.

4 Experimental Results

We present per class results of the SVM one-vs-
rest approach in Table 3 and for the RNN-LSTM
in Table 4 for multi-label and Table 5 for one-vs-
rest. Even though our classiﬁers were trained on
a limited amount of data, we obtain satisfactory
results for the detection of company-speciﬁc eco-
nomic events for most event types. Overall preci-
sion scores are promising, especially for the SVM-
based approach and the RNN-LSTM with hold-in
trained word vectors.

The best overall results are obtained by the lin-
ear kernel SVM which obtained far better recall
than any other model. The one-vs-rest RNN-
LSTM systems comes in at a close second and
outperforms its multi-label counterparts by a large
margin.
Including lexical and syntactic features
seems to be worthwhile when compared to the
straight-forward word vector/token sequence ap-
proach used with the RNN-LSTM.

The best RNN-LSTM multi-label model is out-
performed by the linear kernel SVM approach and
is on par with the optimized RBF kernel approach.
The pre-trained GloVe vectors trained on our own
dataset performed best out of the three input meth-

5ods with a prevalence-weighted macro-averaged
F1-score of 0.66 on hold-out. The GloVe vectors
trained on the 6B corpus obtain worse precision
but slightly better recall, resulting in a compara-
ble F1-score of 0.64. The 6B GloVe inputs ob-
tain better scores on more classes, but their macro-
averaged score is hurt by not detecting any of the
Debt class instances. Not feeding pre-trained em-
beddings to our network shows the worst perfor-
mance of all classiﬁers (F1-score of 0.54).

within the SVM set-up. Underline indicates best

In both one-vs-rest approaches, we trade off
computation time for performance compared to
multi-label systems. This approach also has the
advantage that a separate classiﬁer is produced
for each class. At prediction time, we can thus
trivially apply the best available classiﬁer algo-
rithm from both the SVM and RNN-LSTM sys-
tems for each class. When combining classiﬁers
in this manner an average score of 0.81% preci-

improving over the best scoring single algorithm
system.

5 Error Analysis

We performed a detailed error analysis on the best
classiﬁer in order to gain insights in the main
shortcomings of the current approach.

scores per type for the one-vs-rest RNN-LSTM

In general, we noticed that a fair amount of
event types are characterized by strong lexical
clues. As an example, we can cite the follow-
ing BuyRating example, where the unigrams up-
graded, hold and buy can be considered lexical in-
dicators of this category:

(1) Repair and maintenance group Home-
serve, which also reports on Friday, rose
2.8 per cent to pound(s)17.54 after RBS
upgraded from ”hold” to ”buy”.

Most of the event categories, however, show a
large variety of possible lexicalizations. This is
illustrated by examples 2 and 3 for SalesVolume,
examples 4 and 5 for ShareRepurchase, and exam-
ples 6, 7 and 8 for Turnover:

(2) This could raise doubts about Vodafone’s
target of reaching 10m subscribers by the
end of the current ﬁnancial year.
It will increase the number of Barclays’
customers in France by 25 per cent.

(3)

(4) Last week, Engelhard scotched hopes of
a negotiated deal with BASF, after three
months of ding-dong talks, unveiling in-
stead a defence strategy centred on a
planned Dollars 1.2bn share buy-back at
Dollars 45 a share.

(5) So far, free cash ﬂow has been used to
ﬁnance share buybacks and dividend in-
creases.

(6) The mobile network reseller also forecast
mid-teen percentage growth in service rev-

enue, far better than most analysts had ex-
pected in a tough UK market.

(7) However, revenues from voice and text fell

in the period.

(8) Arun Sarin yesterday sought

to dispel
fears about slowing revenue growth at
Vodafone by saying the mobile phone com-
pany would make more acquisitions in
Africa and Asia.

In addition, some of the lexical clues are am-
biguous in the sense that they occur with vari-
ous event categories. This is for instance the case
for buy, which can be informative to predict the
BuyRating (Example 9) as well as the MergerAc-
quisition (Example 10) event categories:

(9) EMI eased 1.19 per cent to 252p in spite
of a buy recommendation from Deutsche
Bank.

(10) G4S led the blue-chip risers amid con-
tinued speculation that shareholders may
block its pound(s)5.2bn deal to buy ISS,
the ofﬁce cleaning group.

In future work, we intend to improve the lexical
coverage by increasing the data set size, but also
by adding semantic knowledge from structured re-
sources. The following BuyRating event has not
been detected, but this could be the case if down-
grade could be correctly identiﬁed as a lowering
in rating (viz. moving the rating from a buy to a
hold, or a hold to a sell).

(11) The weak oil price and a downgrade from

RBS did the damage.

The same holds for the following MergerAcqui-
sition example, where takeover should be semanti-
cally clustered together with acquire, acquisition,
etc.

(12) News that Hewlett-Packard was preparing
a $10bn takeover offer for the software
maker came too late for London traders to
react.

Furthermore, for some event categories,

the
evaluation set is too limited to draw reliable con-
clusions. As can be noticed in Table 6, which lists
the number of instances per category in the test set,
the Debt and TargetPrice evaluation sets contain
less than ﬁve test items. Collecting and annotating

additional data should lead to a better coverage for
all event categories.

Another source of wrong classiﬁcation was due
to annotation errors in the data set. This is illus-
trated by Example 13, where the buyRating event
was not labeled, and Example 14, where the divi-
dend label was lacking:

(13) Morgan Stanley repeated ” underweight ”
advice in a note sent to clients overnight .
(14) ECS argues Verizon Wireless is a ”pas-
sive investment” for Vodafone because it
last received a dividend in 2004-05, worth
Pounds 923m.

Finally,

the error analysis also revealed that
some strong lexical clues are not always picked
up by the classiﬁer to correctly predict the event
category. We assume this might be due to the very
large feature space, as the SVM classiﬁer is now
trained on more than 300,000 bag-of-words fea-
tures. In addition to the skewed data distribution,
this large feature set makes the machine learning
task very challenging. Therefore, we expect the
classiﬁcation performance to improve by perform-
ing feature selection to determine which sources
of information are most relevant for solving this
learning task. Having a good mechanism to select
informative bag-of-words features should allow to
correctly predict the economic event in case lexi-
cal clues are present in the sentence. In this case,
the following sentence should deﬁnitely be classi-
ﬁed as a MergerAcquisition event:

(15) The acquisition would give CIBC control
of FirstCaribbean with a stake of 87.4 per
cent .

6 Conclusions

This paper presents a dataset and classiﬁcation ex-
periments for company-speciﬁc economic event
detection in English news articles. Currently, there
is little to no data resources and experiments for
supervised, data-driven economic event extrac-
tion. The task was approached as a supervised
classiﬁcation approach and two different machine
learning algorithms, an SVM and RNN-LSTM
learner, were tested for the task. For our Sen-
tiFM event dataset, we have shown that a feature-
engineered SVM approach obtains better perfor-
mance than an RNN-LSTM word-vector system.
The results show good classiﬁcation performance
for most event types, with the linear kernel SVM
outperforming the RBF kernel SVM and RNN-
LSTM set-ups. We demonstrated that data-driven
approaches obtain good recall and can capture
variation in lexicalizations of events to a satisfac-
tory extent.

There is still plenty of room for improvement:
more annotated data and augmentative resources
are needed to further offset ambiguous event ex-
pressions. In future work, we will design a more
ﬁne-grained event detection model that also ex-
tracts the token span of the event below the sen-
tence level. Furthermore, we will work on de-
tecting subevents currently contained in our anno-
tations: e.g. BuyRating: outperform, hold, sell,
upgrade, etc. As feature engineering seems to
pay off for the extraction of economic events, we
will integrate additional linguistic information by
adding semantic knowledge from structured re-
sources such as DBpedia and dedicated ontolo-
gies for economics (e.g. the NewsEvent ontology
(L¨osch and Nikitina, 2009) and derived CoProE
ontology (Kakkonen and Mufti, 2011)) as well as
syntactic information extracted from dependency
parses.
