Abstract

In this paper, we propose a self-attentive
bidirectional
long short-term memory
(SA-BiLSTM) network to predict multi-
ple emotions for the EmotionX challenge.
The BiLSTM exhibits the power of mod-
eling the word dependencies, and extract-
ing the most relevant features for emotion
classiﬁcation. Building on top of BiL-
STM, the self-attentive network can model
the contextual dependencies between ut-
terances which are helpful for classifying
the ambiguous emotions. We achieve 59.6
and 55.0 unweighted accuracy scores in
the Friends and the EmotionPush test sets,
respectively.

Introduction

1
Emotion detection plays a crucial role in develop-
ing a smart dialogue system such as a chit-chat
conversational bot (Chen et al., 2018). As a typ-
ical sub-problem of sentence classiﬁcation, emo-
tion classiﬁcation requires not only to understand
sentence of a single utterance, but also capture the
contextual information from the whole conversa-
tions.

The problems of sentence-level classiﬁcation
have been investigated heavily by means of deep
neural networks, such as convolutional neural net-
works (CNN) (Kim, 2014), long short-term mem-
ory (LSTM) (Liu et al., 2016), and attention-based
CNN (Kim et al., 2018). Additional soft atten-
tion layers (Bahdanau et al., 2014) are usually
built on top of those networks, such that more
attention will be paid to the most relevant words
that lead to a better understanding of the sentence.
LSTMs (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) are
also useful to model contextual dependencies. For
example, a contextual LSTM model is proposed

to select the next sentence based on the former
context (Ghosh et al., 2016), and a bidirectional
LSTM (BiLSTM) is adopted to detect multiple
emotions (Chen et al., 2018).

In this work, we utilize the self-attentive BiL-
STM (SA-BiLSTM) model to predict multiple
types of emotions for the given utterances in the
dialogues. Our model
imitates human’s two-
step procedures for classifying an utterance within
the context, i.e., sentence understanding and con-
textual utterances dependence extraction. More
speciﬁcally, we propose the bidirectional
long
short-term memory (BiLSTM) with the max-
pooling architecture to embed the sentence into a
ﬁxed-size vector, as the BiLSTM network is ca-
pable of modeling the word dependencies in the
sentence while the max-pooling helps to reduce
the model size and obtains the most related fea-
tures for emotion classiﬁcation. Since data in this
challenge is limited and speciﬁc words play sig-
niﬁcant role to classifying the corresponding emo-
tion, we apply the self-attention network (Vaswani
et al., 2017) to extract the dependence of all the
utterances in the dialogue. Technically, the self-
attention model computes the inﬂuence of utter-
ance pairs and outputs the sentence embedding of
one utterance by a weighted sum over all the utter-
ances in the dialogue. The fully connected layers
are then applied on the output sentence embedding
to classify the corresponding emotion.

2 Model

Figure 1 presents our designed model architecture.
First, the pre-trained 300-dimensional GloVe vec-
tors (Pennington et al., 2014) are adopted to rep-
resent each word (token). A sentence (utterance)
with m tokens is then represented by

S = (w1; w2 : : : ; wm);

the i-th tokens in the sentence.

Suppose a dialogue consists of n sentences, the
input forms an n(cid:2) m(cid:2) d tensor, M, see Figure 1.
Via the process of sentence embedding (elaborated
in Section 2.1), the tensor is converted to a n (cid:2) 2l
matrix U, where l is the number of the hidden
units for each unidirectional LSTM. By applying
the self-attentive network, we re-weight the sen-
′ with the same shape
tence embedding matrix to U
as U. Finally, fully connected layers are trained to
′ and the
establish the mapping between input U
output emotion labels.

tion, u.

2.1 Sentence Embedding

In this work, we adopt the BiLSTM to learn the
sentence embedding because it is the most pop-
ular neural network architecture to encode sen-
tences (Conneau et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2017). The
forward LSTM and backward LSTM read the sen-

where ui is the i-th sentence embedding in the dia-
logue, and dk (i.e. 2l) is the model dimension. An
attention mask is applied to waive the inner atten-
tion between sentence embeddings and paddings.
The i-th sentence embedding is ﬁnally weighted
by summing over all the sentence embeddings to
enhance the effect:

softmax (Fi) uj;

j

where Fi is n-dimensional vector whose j-th ele-
ment is f (ui; uj).

2.3 Output and Loss
Finally, we apply fully connected layers to pro-
duce the corresponding emotions. In the training,
the weighted cross-entropy is adopted as the loss
function. Since the challenge only focuses on clas-
sifying four types of emotions, rather than all eight
types, we set the weights to zero for the unconsid-
ered emotions.

3 Experiments and Results
3.1 Data Preprocessing
The EmotionX dataset consists of the Friends TV
scripts and the EmotionPush chat logs on Faceook
Messenger in eight types, i.e., Neutral, Joy, Sad-
ness, Anger, Fear, Surprise, Disgust and Non-
neutral. For the train set, there are 720 dialogues
for Friends and EmotionPush, respectively, which
yields a total of 1,440 dialogues, 21,294 sentences,
and 9,885 unique words. In the challenge, we test
the following candidate labels, Neutral, Joy, Sad-
ness, and Anger. We also conduct the following
steps to clean the data:

(cid:15) Unicode symbols, except emojis (the di-
rect expressions of human emotions), are re-
moved. Person names, locations, numbers
and websites are replaced with special to-
kens.
(cid:15) The Emoji symbols are converted to the cor-
responding meanings.

(cid:15) Duplicated punctuation and symbols. To-
kens with duplicated punctuation or alpha-
bets, such as “oooooh”, often imply non-
neural emotions. We reconstruct the tokens
to be oh <duplicate> to avoid informal
words. The same rule also applies to similar
tokens. For example, “oh!!!!!!” is replaced
by oh !
(cid:15) Word tokenization. We use NLTK’s Twitter-
Tokenizer (Bird, 2006) to split the sentences
into tokens. All tokens are set lowercase.

<duplicate>.

3.2 Experimental Setup
We conduct two experiments with different model
variants: BiLSTM and SA-BiLSTM, to validate
whether our proposed model can learn the contex-
tual information. The network settings for each
model are summarized as follows:

(cid:15) BiLSTM: BiLSTM + max-pooling + fully
connected layers.
(cid:15) SA-BiLSTM: BiLSTM + max-pooling +
self-attentive network + fully connected lay-
ers.

The word embedding is 300-dimensional from the
the Glove. Pack padded sequence and pad packed
sequence are implemented to deal with varying se-
quence lengths. For SA-BiLSTM, we limit the ut-
terance number to 25 for each dialogue. Due to
the limit of training data, LSTM is set to one layer
with only 256 hidden units. The fully connected
layers consist of two middle layers with the same
size of 128.

The mini-batch size for training BiLSTM is
set to 16. Unlike BiLSTM, we feed one di-
alogue to SA-BiLSTM for every training step.
Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014) is the adopted op-
timizer with initial learning rate 0.0002 and decay
factor 0.99 for every epoch. Dropout probability
is set to 0.3 for BiLSTM and self-attention layers.
We train BiLSTM for 10 epochs and SA-BiLSTM
for 20 epochs to gain the best accuracy in the val-
idation sets.

3.3 BiLSTM Versus SA-BiLSTM
Table 1 reports the model performance in the val-
idation sets, which consist of 80 dialogues for
Friends and EmotionPush, respectively. We eval-
uate two criteria,
the weighted accuracy (WA)
and the unweighted accuracy (UWA) (Chen et al.,

also given in the table.

Interestingly,

the simpler model BiLSTM
achieves higher WA, with up to 0.6% and 0.5%
improvement in Friends and EmotionPush, re-
spectively. On the other hand, SA-BiLSTM over-
performs BiLSTM in terms of UWA, with up to
1.4% and 1.7% improvement. Note that BiLSTM
tends to predict the emotions Neutral and Joy far
more accurate than the other two emotions be-
cause most utterances are labeled as these two
emotions, i.e., 45.03% as neural and 11.79% as
joy in Friends while 66.85% as neural and 14.25%
as joy in EmotionPush. Overall, SA-BiLSTM pro-
vides a more balanced prediction for each type of
emotion than BiLSTM. Especially in predicting
the emotions of Sadness and Anger, SA-BiLSTM
gains better predictive accuracy, up to 11.3% &
6.0% on the Sadness emotion and 5.9% & 5.3% on
the Anger emotion improvements in Friends and
EmotionPush, respectively.

3.4 Results of Test Set
We submit the results produced by SA-BiLSTM
and obtain the evaluation scores provided by the
challenge organizer. Table 2 lists the experimen-
tal results evaluated in the test set, which consists
of 400 dialogues, 200 dialogues for Friends and
EmotionPush, respectively.

The results indicate that our model shows a
strong bias towards predicting the Neutral emotion
and the Joy emotion in both datasets compared to
the Sadness and the Anger emotions. Especially,
our model achieves an extremely poor prediction
on the Anger emotion in EmotionPush. Moreover,
the UWA in EmotionPush is smaller than that in

Friends, which is different from our prediction re-
sults in the validation set. We conjecture that the
distribution of the validation set and the test set
may be slightly different. To obtain a robust solu-
tion, we may train multiple models using different
random seeds and ensemble the model averaged
on the checkpoints.

We notice that the Speaker information is also
important for emotion classiﬁcation.
Table 3
shows two consecutive utterances made by the
same speaker from EmotionPush, where the ﬁrst
utterance seems literally less emotional than the
second one. Nevertheless,
the two utterances
should carry the same emotion, i.e., Anger, be-
cause they are made by the same speaker consec-
utively. On the contrary, our model gives a false
prediction (i.e., Neutral) for the second utterance
because it probably treats the two utterance sepa-
rately. We believe that our model shall gain some
improvements by adding speaker information into
it.

4 Conclusion
In this work, we propose SA-BiLSTM to predict
multiple emotions for given utterances in the dia-
logues. The proposed network is a self-attentive
network built on top of BiLSTM. Our results eval-
uated on the validation set show that BiLSTM has

vantageous to BiLSTM in terms of UWA. Accord-
ing to the test results, SA-BiLSTM yields higher
UWA scores for detecting the Neural emotion and
the Joy emotions than the Sadness and the Anger
ones. The bias may be caused by uneven train-
ing data distributions. We hope to improve our
model by either incorporating more related data or
retrieving more linguistic information.
