The integration and coordination of management activities focused on ensuring the organization fulfils stakeholder requirements predictably, consistently, and 
reliably.

Note: Quality Management comprises quality planning, quality assurance, quality control, quality appraisal, and quality improvement.
Note 2: Development of stakeholder requirements for particular translation projects is defined in ASTM F2575-14, Section 8 (Specifications)
Quality management activities for designing a system of policies, processes, and procedures to be followed capable of producing products that will meet 
stakeholder requirements.
Quality management activities of auditing processes and procedures to provide confidence to management, customers, and third parties that stakeholder 
requirements can be fulfilled.

Note: Quality assurance is often used as a synonym for quality appraisal in industry, but this conflation creates a strong source of confusion, and shall not be used 
in this fashion.
Quality management activities for monitoring and assessing process and performance in real time in order to verify that stakeholder requirements are being 
fulfilled and that quality measures are being maintained within proscribed limits. 

Note: In quality control, data collected in real time is analyzed and used during production (vs. being stored only for future quality assurance audits).
Quality management activities for validating that stakeholder requirements have been fulfilled through inspection, examination, and testing.

Note 1: Quality evaluation comes after production and prior to delivery to the consumer or requester.
Note 2: This activity is sometimes called “quality appraisal” in industry segments outside of translation.
Quality management activities for preventing variation from stakeholder requirements in the product by eliminating sources of variation in the process. 

Note 1: Continuous improvement of the process will have benefits across products and over time.
Note 2: Sources of variation in the process include improperly designed policies, poor resources, or inconsistent application of procedures.

• No industry agreement about what constitutes quality
(“I know it when I see it”)
• How can we achieve what we can’t define?
• European approach (ISO 17100) is process-oriented: can’t tell you for 
sure whether the product is good
• Most translated content is accepted based on trust (95% of text from 
one major LSP is never checked)
• Many different systems/standards claim to solve the problem, but they 
disagree about what to measure and how

AMTA 2018 Tutorial: MQM-DQF: A Good MarriageBoston, March 17, 2018   |   Page 5What is translation quality?

A quality translation 
demonstrates accuracy and fluency required 
for the audience and purpose and complies 
with all other specifications negotiated 
between the requester and provider, taking 
into account both requester goals and end-
user needs.

AMTA 2018 Tutorial: MQM-DQF: A Good MarriageBoston, March 17, 2018   |   Page 6Measure vs. metric

• A measure determines some property of an item:

• This table provides 74 cm clearance
• This house is 200m2

• A metric is a measurement with a purpose:

• We are measuring tables to determine which ones will allow a wheel-chair to slide 

beneath them

• We are determining whether the house is big enough for a family with six children

• Thresholds are the criteria we use to determine whether something 
measured with a metric meets requirements:

• The table must have at least 77 cm of clearance and no more than 79.
• The house requires 25 m2 per family member

AMTA 2018 Tutorial: MQM-DQF: A Good MarriageBoston, March 17, 2018   |   Page 7A typology of translation quality 
metrics

AMTA 2018 Tutorial: MQM-DQF: A Good MarriageBoston, March 17, 2018   |   Page 8Typology of translation quality metrics

• Holistic vs. analytic
• Fine-grained vs. coarse
• Reference-based vs. reference-free
• Objective vs. subjective

AMTA 2018 Tutorial: MQM-DQF: A Good MarriageBoston, March 17, 2018   |   Page 9Holistic metrics

• Look at the entire text to provide a single result
• E.g.,

• This translation (as a whole) has a ____ score of 96.5.
• 76% of users rated the translation as “useful”

AMTA 2018 Tutorial: MQM-DQF: A Good MarriageBoston, March 17, 2018   |   Page 10Analytic metrics

• Measure multiple qualities and allow decomposition of any single 
score
• E.g.,

• This translation has a score of 96.3, with 100 for accuracy, 98 for fluency, and 

92 for style (a composite metric)

• 76% of users rated the translated text as good using a three-section rating 

scale that covers readability, technical accuracy, and ease of use.

AMTA 2018 Tutorial: MQM-DQF: A Good MarriageBoston, March 17, 2018   |   Page 11Fine-grained vs. coarse

• Varying degrees of analytic metrics: Some identify individual issues 
and allow decomposition down to individual errors
• A coarse metric: Accuracy and Fluency
• A fine-grained metric:

Which is better?

• Accuracy

• Fluency

• Addition
• Mistranslation
• Omission

• Grammar
• Spelling
• Typography…

AMTA 2018 Tutorial: MQM-DQF: A Good MarriageBoston, March 17, 2018   |   Page 12Reference-based vs. reference-free

• Reference-based: Comparison against a “gold standard”
• Reference-free: No point of comparison

AMTA 2018 Tutorial: MQM-DQF: A Good MarriageBoston, March 17, 2018   |   Page 13Objective vs. subjective

• Objective: Metric is based on observable facts that are – in principle –
not dependent upon the individual applying the metric
• Subjective: Metric is based on the reaction of the individual and 
depend on taste or other non-objective factors
• Which of these is possible with translation?

AMTA 2018 Tutorial: MQM-DQF: A Good MarriageBoston, March 17, 2018   |   Page 14Exercise: Categorize various metrics

• LISA QA Model
• BLEU
• Customer feedback survey
• Post-editing distance
• Adequacy and fluency rating
• Output ranking
• Compliance with terminology list

AMTA 2018 Tutorial: MQM-DQF: A Good MarriageBoston, March 17, 2018   |   Page 16Overview of MQM/DQF & Key 
Features

AMTA 2018 Tutorial: MQM-DQF: A Good MarriageBoston, March 17, 2018   |   Page 17MQM-DQF

• The intersection of MQM and DQF (just one part of each)
• Focuses on product quality
• Analytic (error typology) focus:

• Identify the nature of problems with a goal of preventing or correcting them
• Relate problems to a list of known issue type

• Divides issues into high-level issues
• MQM defines a superset of issues checked in industry and provides a 
way for tools to declare what they check and compare it with other 
tools

AMTA 2018 Tutorial: MQM-DQF: A Good MarriageBoston, March 17, 2018   |   Page 18Dimensions

Terminology Issues
• Terminology Issues
(bilingual and monolingual)
Bilingual
• Accuracy
• Locale convention
• Internationalization
• Verity/Locale suitability

Monolingual
• Fluency
• Style
• Design

AMTA 2018 Tutorial: MQM-DQF: A Good MarriageBoston, March 17, 2018   |   Page 19Terminology

• Bilingual:

• Not using a specified termbase
• Not using established terminology for a domain

• Monolingual:

• Inconsistent use of terms within a document for the same concept

AMTA 2018 Tutorial: MQM-DQF: A Good MarriageBoston, March 17, 2018   |   Page 20Accuracy

• Does the target text convey the same information that the source text 
does?
• Can be determined only by comparison to the source text.
• Not identical to adequacy

AMTA 2018 Tutorial: MQM-DQF: A Good MarriageBoston, March 17, 2018   |   Page 21Locale convention

• Mechanical aspects of localization such as representation of dates 
and times.
• Note 1: Locale-convention issues are often identified by software in 
the category QA Checkers.
• Note 2: A few other mechanical aspects of localization (Locale-
convention issues) involve conversion of units of measure such as 
meters vs yards or degrees Fahrenheit vs. Celsius or euros vs. 
Canadian dollars: based on specified source-locale vs. target-locale)

AMTA 2018 Tutorial: MQM-DQF: A Good MarriageBoston, March 17, 2018   |   Page 22Internationalization

• Issues related to whether or not the source content has been created 
to facilitate subsequent localization
• Note: An internationalization error is not a translation error as such, 
but lack of proper internationalization is typically manifested in a 
translation error or failure for software to function as expected. 
• For example, if insufficient space is allowed for a string (such as a 
menu item or a message), the translation of that string might be 
truncated if it is longer than the source string.

AMTA 2018 Tutorial: MQM-DQF: A Good MarriageBoston, March 17, 2018   |   Page 23Verity/Locale suitability

• Aspects of localization other than locale-convention, that is, those 
requiring human detection and judgement, namely, target-text 
suitability issues because of differences between source and target 
locale).
• Note: This dimension includes adjustments for differences in culture, 
usages, laws, or even physical aspects of the geographical region such 
as the shape of electrical plugs. It is sometimes called Verity (in the 
sense of “accordance with fact”) because it concerns whether 
something matches the facts of the target locale.

AMTA 2018 Tutorial: MQM-DQF: A Good MarriageBoston, March 17, 2018   |   Page 24Fluency

• Is the text linguistically well-formed?
• Can be assessed without consulting a source text
• Includes items often called “language errors”

AMTA 2018 Tutorial: MQM-DQF: A Good MarriageBoston, March 17, 2018   |   Page 25Style

• Monolingual style manual
• Use of other specified target-language resources such as relevant 
reference documents in target language, and other style issues such 
as those regarding register, collocations, and structural awkwardness. 
• Style issues should be as clearly specified as possible to avoid 
subjectivity and hyper revision

AMTA 2018 Tutorial: MQM-DQF: A Good MarriageBoston, March 17, 2018   |   Page 26Design

• Monolingual layout, formatting, and markup issues, not explicitly 
covered in a specified style manual
• Appearance of text (i.e., the accuracy and fluency are OK, but the text 
looks wrong)

AMTA 2018 Tutorial: MQM-DQF: A Good MarriageBoston, March 17, 2018   |   Page 27Quality = spaghetti?
• Too many issues, but…
• Somebody checks everything we have in the master MQM set
• Based on an analysis of existing quality specifications (public and private)
• Can be overwhelming
• So… Use the DQF subset of MQM

AMTA 2018 Tutorial: MQM-DQF: A Good MarriageBoston, March 17, 2018   |   Page 45Validity

• Does the metric measure what it is supposed to?
• Are the qualities appropriate to the goal?
• Does the metric determine whether specifications have been met?
• Examples:

• Using Style to evaluate a support manual
• Using Accuracy and Verity to evaluate a support manual

AMTA 2018 Tutorial: MQM-DQF: A Good MarriageBoston, March 17, 2018   |   Page 46Reliability

• Can the metric consistently – across time and across assessors –
deliver the same results?
• Tolerance
• Inter-annotator agreement
• Can multiple evaluators agree upon the same result?
