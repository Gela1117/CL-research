Terminology issues relate to the use of

Add more terms to glossary / add new 
glossaries

Translation omits source information

Find out why MT omits information

Term that should stay untranslated is 
translated

Add terms to NTA list /Tag them in pre-
processing

Term that should be translated stays 
untranslated

Find out in what areas; we may need 
additional corpora (what kind?)

Mistranslation

Term incorrectly translated

Find out whether there is a pattern

Fluency

Grammar - word form

Morphological problem - E.g. “has 
becomed” instead of “became”.

Fix in corpora / with PEX rules

Grammar - word order

Bad word order

Fix in engine / with PEX rules

Locale

Format problems - measurement, currency, 
date/time, address, telephone...

The text does not adhere to locale-specific 
mechanical conventions and violates 
requirements for the presentation of 
content in the target locale.

Fix with PEX rules

Engine Refinement – An Effective Error Typology
Error Typology for Source Content (DQF-MQM customized subset)

Category
Ambiguity

Sub-category Definition

The text is ambiguous in its meaning. 

Grammar

Function words, word-form, word-order. Typos affecting MT 
translation. 

Action 
Look for a pattern – always identify the error cause when possible. Examples:
- Misused punctuation (e.g. “we had problems, coming home” vs “we had 
problems; coming home”; “high end designer item” vs “high-end designer 
item”)
- Overuse of the -ing form (“I will want you to study after watching TV” can 
mean “after I watch TV” or “after you watch TV”)
- Wrong capitalization (e.g. with a UI element: “Employment Fraud” vs 
“employment fraud”. Makes it difficult to recognize if this is a UI element (and 
should stay in English) or not)
- Others

Look for a pattern (gender/number disagreements, incorrect word order that 
may cause MT problems)
Examples:
- high end designer item vs high-end designer item
-> Missing hyphen
- 3day duration
->  Missing space grammar error

Terminology

Design - Markup Markup

Inconsistency - multiple words for one concept. Lack of consistency 
may produce incorrect MT translations, especially in Neural MT.

Provide recommended term.

Issues related to “markup” (codes used to represent structure or 
formatting of text, also known as “tags”). Wrong markup can cause 
tags to be exposed for translation, or missing, which causes a loss 
of meaning. 

Report for content creators to fix. When in doubt as to whether the missing 
content is a placeholder, use the Ambiguity error type.
Examples:
- Full URLs: “ATO 
%20UK%20Communication%20Preferences%20Change.png" />”
- Missing placeholders: “Actively selling when   occurs”

Data for Quality and Productivity: A Representative Sample

Horizontal Center

By Silvio Picinini, eBay BPT MTLS

Our sample mirrors the CS TM length distribution:
- Short segments (1-4 words): little context
- Medium segments (6-12 words) simple full 
sentences
- Long segments (13-35 words) complex sentences

5 sets of  short-medium-long segments:
- 2 for post-editing 
- 1 for human translation (to compare with PE)
- 1 for human evaluation

Eyebrow Baseline

Horizontal Center

PER SEGMENT LENGHT
A uniform ratio between edit distance and time to 
edit, except for very short segments, that require 
proportionally more time (likely significant terms, 
requiring more research)

PER TRANSLATOR
ED and time are mostly aligned, with one exception.
one of the linguists’s (vendor) time to edit is an outlier.

Correlation 1: Outliers in Quality – Edit Distance – Time

Horizontal Center

Similar quality, similar edit distance, one outlier in time spent: 
Further training on post-editing may be useful

Feedback from Participating Linguists
We surveyed all 4 linguists 
involved in the pilot:

Lessons learned:

- Ensure good communication: 

-

Initial presentation with high-level 
goals

- For every stage, clear statement of 

goals and expectations

- Clearly defined key terms (BLEU, 

Eyebrow Baseline

ranking, rating, A/B test…)

- Provide sufficient context for HT/PE 

(no random strings, enough strings before 
and after)

Very high (~5% standard deviation)
Likely thanks to ranking scale choice (1-3)

Use simple tools and basic resources 
(drop TM, use basic instructions)

- Minimize the number of variables:

What We Found:

PILOT GOAL
Which is the best engine?

- For the final user: NMT

For the post-editor/vendor: NMT

Horizontal Center

RESEARCH GOALS
- Is BLEU equally reliable for SMT and NMT? NO

- Is there a difference between perceived quality and PE 
effort? YES
- Segment length – HE quality:

Does length affect adequacy/fluency YES
Does NMT and SMT quality vary per segment 
length YES

ORGANIZATIONAL GOALS
- Which are the best roles for each of the stakeholders?

- MT Vendor: Engine background support
- eBay MTLS: engine creation, data curation, 
supporting/training LS for these roles
- eBay regular LS (for now): quality evaluation
