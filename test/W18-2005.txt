• Disconnect between MT development and commercial translation 

production that includes MT

• Reference-based methods (such as BLEU et al.) is central to MT development
• Reference-free quality evaluation is central to commercial translation 

production

• See MT Escaped from the Lab. Now What? (Mike Dillinger, AMTA 2016)

• These standards are influential among implementers of MT
• Systematically improving MT requires knowledge about what MT 

does wrong and why one translation is better than another (requires 
analytic understanding)

71

Proceedings of AMTA 2018 Workshop: The Role of Authoritative Standards in the MT EnvironmentBoston, March 17 - 21, 2018What do we mean by translation 
quality?

72

Proceedings of AMTA 2018 Workshop: The Role of Authoritative Standards in the MT EnvironmentBoston, March 17 - 21, 2018Well, what do we mean by “translation”?

• A translation (product) is target-language content corresponds to 

source-language content

• Must include text
• May include non-textual elements such as audio-visual content and software 

components

• Translation (process) is the action of creating target-language content 

that corresponds to source-language content according a set of 
specifications

73

Proceedings of AMTA 2018 Workshop: The Role of Authoritative Standards in the MT EnvironmentBoston, March 17 - 21, 2018What is translation quality?

• A subject of debate and contention
• Multiple measurement approaches are current
• Major disconnect between traditional human translation approaches 

and what MT developers do

• No one-size-fits-all set of specifications (more later)

74

Proceedings of AMTA 2018 Workshop: The Role of Authoritative Standards in the MT EnvironmentBoston, March 17 - 21, 2018Process vs. product

Process-centric
Emphasize the role of process 
steps on output quality
Repeatability and consistency are 
the key
Cannot determine whether the 
output meets requirements

Product-centric
Focus on measuring conformance 
of translated content
Can measure how well processes 
are delivering on expectations
Cannot verify process compliance 
or suitability

75

Proceedings of AMTA 2018 Workshop: The Role of Authoritative Standards in the MT EnvironmentBoston, March 17 - 21, 2018Universal or specifications-based

Universal
There exists a set of one or more 
translations that are correct in all 
circumstances
Translations are good or bad

You could apply one set of criteria 
to any translation

Specifications
Translations must conform to 
specifications: What works for one 
set may not work for another
Translations are good or bad with 
respect to external factors
Different requirements need 
different criteria

76

Proceedings of AMTA 2018 Workshop: The Role of Authoritative Standards in the MT EnvironmentBoston, March 17 - 21, 2018Reference-based or reference-free

Reference-based
Quality is measured by similarity to 
a known-good translation
Quick and cheap
Gives a score for the translation as 
a whole with no insight into 
specific issues
Common in the MT world

Reference-free
Quality is measured by examining 
the product itself
Comparatively expensive and slow
Provides insight into specific issues 
and allows decomposition (roll-
down) of scores
Common in the HT world

assurance and assessment —
Models and metrics 

78

Proceedings of AMTA 2018 Workshop: The Role of Authoritative Standards in the MT EnvironmentBoston, March 17 - 21, 2018A general framework for translation quality

• Defines quality-related terms
• Sets up criteria for:

• Job assignment and acceptance
• Style
• Consistency
• Terminology

• Establishes a process for quality assessment of translation
• Discusses methods

79

Proceedings of AMTA 2018 Workshop: The Role of Authoritative Standards in the MT EnvironmentBoston, March 17 - 21, 2018Status

• Currently a committee draft
• Working through the ISO process
• Proposes a high-level typology of errors that is broadly compatible 

with MQM-DQF

services – Requirements for

81

Proceedings of AMTA 2018 Workshop: The Role of Authoritative Standards in the MT EnvironmentBoston, March 17 - 21, 2018A process-oriented approach to quality

• Defines processes that translation providers should follow to produce 

appropriate output
• Certifiable standard
• Replaces EN15038
• Widely implemented by language service providers
• Not generally applicable to MT

for Quality Assurance in 
Translation

83

Proceedings of AMTA 2018 Workshop: The Role of Authoritative Standards in the MT EnvironmentBoston, March 17 - 21, 2018Defines a stakeholder-oriented approach

• Emphasizes the role of specifications and factors that stakeholders 

need to consider

• Defines 21 parameters that need to be defined for projects

• These serve as the basis for the MQM-DQF approach
• Cover linguistic, production, environment, and relationship factors

• Apply to all translation projects, but does not define metrics for 

measuring quality

• The approaches in F2575 are largely ignored in MT circles, which 

results in a lack of clarity

(Translation Quality Assessment)

85

Proceedings of AMTA 2018 Workshop: The Role of Authoritative Standards in the MT EnvironmentBoston, March 17 - 21, 2018The F43 approach to quality

• ASTM F43 takes a functionalist approach, consistent with quality 

management principles:

A quality translation demonstrates accuracy and fluency required for 
the audience and purpose and complies with all other 
specifications negotiated between the requester and provider, taking 
into account both requester goals and end-user needs.

86

Proceedings of AMTA 2018 Workshop: The Role of Authoritative Standards in the MT EnvironmentBoston, March 17 - 21, 2018Genesis of WK46396

• TAUS Dynamic Quality Framework (DQF)

• Arose from industry group
• Focused on multiple approaches to quality (adequacy and fluency, error 

review, productivity measurement, MT ranking, and comparison)

• Contained a relatively simple error typology

• DFKI Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM)

• funded by European Commission in the QTLaunchPad and QTLeap projects
• Focused on an exhaustive and robust typology of translation errors divided 

into multiple dimensions

• Unified error typology in 2014–2015 as a requirement of the 

European Commission

Proceedings of AMTA 2018 Workshop: The Role of Authoritative Standards in the MT EnvironmentBoston, March 17 - 21, 2018Approaches to quality evaluation

• Emphasizes analytic quality (identification and quantification of 

errors)

• Applies to both machine and human translation: Complements 

reference-based approaches such as BLEU

• Strives for consistency with ISO 9000-series approaches to quality 

management

• Emphasizes fairness
• Optionally considers source text as well as target text

more fine-grained issue 
types that extend 
further. Implementations 
use subsets

Proceedings of AMTA 2018 Workshop: The Role of Authoritative Standards in the MT EnvironmentBoston, March 17 - 21, 2018Focus of ASTM effort

• How to create custom metrics based on MQM-DQF
• Tied to translation specifications as defined in ASTM F2575
• Currently working on a complete draft to be ready by October
• Error typology will be maintained in W3C Community Group to 

ensure free and open access

• Required by IP donors and European Commission (MQM was taxpayer 

funded)

• W3C connection will promote closer ties with other standardization efforts 

and increase visibility for the error typology

93

Proceedings of AMTA 2018 Workshop: The Role of Authoritative Standards in the MT EnvironmentBoston, March 17 - 21, 2018Observations

• Translation quality is a hot topic
• A lot of people are trying to solve it
• The market is shifting towards MQM-DQF:

• A good sign for the ASTM WK46349 effort

• ISO 17100 has high recognition among LSPs
• ISO 21999 is still in its infancy
• We still need to do more to bridge the gap between the 

BLEU/METEOR-centric approach of MT developers and the needs of 
consumers, translators, and LSPs
