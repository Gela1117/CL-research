as  the  previous  state.  For  example,  a  part-of-
speech (POS) tag depends on the word itself, as 
well as the POS tag transitions from the previous 
word. In the problem, the POS tags are adjacent to 
each other in a text forming a tag sequence
fore, the sequence labeling model can fully capture 
dependencies between labels. 

In contrast, a CRF in named entity recognition 

(NER) cannot fully capture dependencies between 
named entity (NE) labels. According to Ratinov & 
Roth (2009), named entities in a text are separated 
by successive “outside tokens” (i.e., words that are 
non-named entities syntactically linking two NEs) 
and considerable number of NEs have a tendency 
to exist at a distance from each other. Therefore, 
high-order interdependencies of named entities be-
tween successive 
by first-order or second-order transition factors. 

One  major  issue  in  previous  studies  was  con-

cerned with the way in which to explore long-dis-
tance  dependencies  in  NER.  Only  dependencies 
between  neighbor  labels  are  generally  used  in 
practice  because  conventional  high-order  CRFs 
are  known  to  be  intractable  in  NER  (Ye,  Lee, 
Chieu,  &  Wu,  2009).  Previous  studies  have 
demonstrated  that  implementation  of  the  higher-
order  CRF  exploiting  pre-defined  label  patterns 
leads  to  slight  performance  improvement  in  the 
conventional  CRF  in  NER  (Cuong,  Ye,  Lee,  & 
Chieu,  2014;  Fersini,  Messina,  Felici
2014; Sarawagi & Cohen, 2005; Ye et al., 2009)
However, there are certain drawbacks associated 
with handling named entity transitions within arbi-
trary length outside tokens.

information of NEs through non-named entity to-

This paper presents a method of designing 
specific  high-order  dependency  factor  on 
the linear chain conditional  random  fields 
(CRFs) for named entity recognition (NER). 
Named  entities  tend  to  be  separated  from 
each other by multiple outside tokens in a 
text, and thus the first-order CRF, as well as 
the  second-order  CRF,  may  innately  lose 
transition 
between 
named  entities. The  proposed  design  uses 
outside label in NER as a transmission me-
dium of precedent entity information on the 
CRF.  Then,  empirical  results  apparently 
demonstrate  that  it  is  possible  to  exploit 
long-distance label dependency in the orig-
inal  first-order  linear  chain  CRF  structure 
upon  NER  while  reducing  computational 
loss rather than in the second-order CRF.

The concept of conditional random fields (CRFs) 
(John  Lafferty, Andrew  McCallum,  &  Fernando 
Pereira,  2001)  has  been  successfully  adapted  in 
many 
problems 
McCallum & Wei Li, 2003; Fei Sha & Fernando 
Pereira, 
Lafferty 
McDonald & Pereira, 2005). Even in deep-learn-
ing architecture, CRF has been used as a funda-
mental  element  in  named  entity  recognition 
(Lample, Ballesteros, Subramanian, Kawakami, & 
Dyer, 2016; Liu, Tang, Wang, & Chen, 2017)

John 

al., 

et 

2003; 

One of the primary advantages of applying the 

CRF to language processing is that it learns transi-
tion factors between hidden variables correspond-
ing to the label of single word. The fundamental 
assumption of the model is that the current hidden 
state is conditioned on present observation as well

fies the first-order linear-chain CRF by using the 
induction method.

is formed in a linear chain in NER; for example, a 
sequence 
side words are between the two NE words. Because 
the first-order model assumes that state transition 
dependencies exist only between proximate two la-
bels to prevent an increase in computational com-
plexity,  the  first-order  CRF  learns  bigram  label

The main purpose of the precursor-induced CRF 
model, introduced in this study, is to capture spe-
cific high-order named entity dependency that is an 
outside  word  sequence  between  two  NEs.  The 
main idea can be explained in the following man-
ner:

corpus, 58.9% cases of NEs having 
dence have a preceding named entity. Median value 
of the distance between consecutive entities tend to 
be within 3-4 in the datasets. The long distance de-
pendency is restricted within a single instance (i.e., 
a sentence). 

To perform NER evaluation, two types of feature 
families are used: (a) token itself and neighbor to-
kens  in  window  size  3.  In  addition,  morphologi-
cally normalized tokens are used together. (b) mor-
phology features such as character prefix and suffix 
of length 2–4. Our 
feature family (a) and 
ously uses both of the feature family (a) and (b). 
The reason for setting these simple feature config-
urations is for the purpose of reducing bias that the 
feature will affect the performance comparison of 
the models. 

In order to compare the proposed model with the 

conventional CRF, both the first-order and the sec-
ond-order CRF are used as baseline models.

The performance comparison result is shown in 
the Table 1. The result shows a tendency that pre-
cursor-induced (pre-induced) CRF leads to a slight 
performance  improvement  compared  to  both  the 
first-order and second-order CRFs in  most cases. 
However, the overall improvement is small. 

Table 2 compares the elapsed time per iteration 
in  parameter  training  for  each  model.  The  result 
shows that the second-order CRF takes quite more 
time than the first-order CRF to compute one train-
ing iteration. The pre-induced CRF takes 1.7 times 
more computation time than the first-order CRF in 
average. The pre-induced CRF takes significantly 
less time than the second-order CRF while the pre-
induced  CRF  exploits  longer  label  transition  de-
pendency than the second-order CRF. 

These results indicate that the precursor-induced 
CRF,  where  long-distance  dependency  is  intro-
duced in CRF by label induction, slightly improves 
the effectiveness  in  clinical  and  biomedical  NER 
while  also  significantly  reducing  computational 
cost  rather  than  building  second-  or  higher-order 
CRFs.

CRF apparently allows precedent named entity in-
formation to pass through

template. Although the performance improvement 
is small in both the clinical and biomedical NER 
evaluations, this study has shown that the proposed 
design enables reduced computational cost in uti-
lizing long-distance label dependency compared to 
the second-order CRF. 

 Evidence from this study suggests that the utili-

zation  of 
mation transmission medium presumably can en-
hance the expressiveness of the CRF while keeping 
the first-order template. Considerable work is re-
quired to validate the model. For example, the val-
idation of the precursor-induced CRF in deep neu-
ral architecture for NER, such as the LSTM-CRF 
neural  architecture (Lample  et  al.,  2016),  will  be 
worth performing in the future. In addition, valida-
tion of the model in various problems, such as NER 
in general domain (Tjong, Sang, & Meulder, 2003) 
and de-identification problem of personal health in-
formation  in  clinical  natural  language  processing 
(Stubbs,  Filannino,  &  Uzuner,  2017;  Stubbs,
