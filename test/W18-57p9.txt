Abstract

Multimodal search-based dialogue is a
challenging new task:
It extends visu-
ally grounded question answering sys-
tems into multi-turn conversations with
access to an external database. We ad-
dress this new challenge by learning a
neural response generation system from
the recently released Multimodal Dialogue
(MMD) dataset (Saha et al., 2017). We
introduce a knowledge-grounded multi-
modal conversational model where an en-
coded knowledge base (KB) representa-
tion is appended to the decoder input. Our
model substantially outperforms strong
baselines in terms of text-based similarity
measures (over 9 BLEU points, 3 of which
are solely due to the use of additional in-
formation from the KB).

Introduction

1
Conversational agents have become ubiquitous,
with variants ranging from open-domain conversa-
tional chit-chat bots (Ram et al., 2018; Papaioan-
nou et al., 2017; Fang et al., 2017) to domain-
speciﬁc task-based dialogue systems (Singh et al.,
2000; Rieser and Lemon, 2010, 2011; Young et al.,
2013; Wen et al., 2017).

Our work builds upon the recently released
Multimodal Dialogue (MMD) dataset (Saha et al.,
2017), which contains dialogue sessions in the e-
commerce (fashion) domain. Figure 1 illustrates
an example chat session with multimodal interac-
tion between the user and the system. We focus
on the task of generating textual responses con-
ditioned on the previous conversational history.
Traditional goal-oriented dialogue systems relied
on slot-ﬁlling approach to this task, i.e. explicit
modelling of all attributes in the domain (Lemon

et al., 2006; Wang and Lemon, 2013; Young et al.,
2013). On the other hand, previous work on MMD
data used direct learning from raw texts with im-
plicit semantic representation only. This paper
attempts to combine both approaches by learn-
ing to generate replies from raw user input, while
also incorporating Knowledge Base (KB) inputs
(i.e. explicit semantics) into the generation pro-
cess. We discuss how our model is able to handle
various user intents (request types) and the impact
of incorporating the additional explicit semantic
information from the KB into particular targeted
intents. We use user intent annotation and KB
queries provided with the dataset for the purpose
of this work.

Our main contribution is the resulting fully
data-driven model for the task of conversational
multimodal dialogue generation, grounded in con-
versational text history, vision and KB inputs. We
also illustrate a method to improve context mod-
elling over multiple images and show great im-
provements over the baseline. Finally, we present
a detailed analysis of the outputs generated by our
system corresponding to different user intents.

2 Related Work

With recent progress in deep learning, there is
continued interest in the tasks involving both vi-
sion and language, such as image captioning (Xu
et al., 2015; Vinyals et al., 2015; Karpathy and Fei-
Fei, 2015), visual storytelling (Huang et al., 2016),
video description (Venugopalan et al., 2015b,a) or
dialogue grounded in visual context (Antol et al.,
2015; Das et al., 2017; Tapaswi et al., 2016).

Bordes et al. (2016) and Ghazvininejad et al.
(2017) presented knowledge-grounded neural
models; however, these are uni-modal in nature,
involve only textual interaction and do not take
into account the conversational history in a dia-

sions (see Section 3).

3 Knowledge grounded Multimodal

Conversational model

While Saha et al. (2017) propose Multimodal
HRED (M-HRED) by extending T-HRED to in-
clude visual context over images,
they do not
ground their dialogue context over an external
database. Also, they limit the visual information
by ‘unrolling’ multiple images to just use the last
image of a single turn. For example in Figure 1,
Saha et al. (2017) consider only the last image of
trousers as visual context in Agent’s response A4.
In contrast, we include all the images in a single
turn using a linear layer (see Agarwal et al. (2018)
for a detailed analysis).

In addition, we devise a mechanism to ground
our textual responses on a KB; Figure 3 depicts
the full pipeline of our model. We combine tex-
tual and visual representations at the encoder level
and pass it through the HRED’s context encoder
(cf. Figure 2), which learns the backbone of the
conversation (see Section 3.1). Subsequently, we
inject knowledge from the KB at the decoder level
in each timestep (see Sections 3.2 and 3.3).

Formally, we model a dialogue as a sequence
of utterances (turns) which are considered as se-
quences of words and images:

Pθ(t1, . . . tN ) =

Pθ(tn|t<n)

(1)

Here tn represents the n-th utterance in a dialogue.

n=1

modal user-agent interaction in a dialogue ses-

tional history.

logue. In contrast, our system grounds on a KB
while also conditioning on previous dialogue con-
text which is multimodal in nature, consisting of
both textual and visual communication between
the user and the system. We formulate our KB
input from a database query (triggered by the sys-
tem) similar to Sha et al. (2018), as described in
Section 3.2.

Our model belongs to the encoder-decoder
paradigm where sequence-to-sequence models
(Cho et al., 2014; Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau
et al., 2015) have become the de-facto standard
for natural language generation. However, they
tend to ignore the conversational history in a di-
alogue. The Hierarchical Recurrent Encoder De-
coder (HRED) architecture (Serban et al., 2016,
2017; Lu et al., 2016) addresses this limitation by
using a context recurrent neural network (RNN),
forming a hierarchical encoder. We build upon
these HRED models and refer to them as Text-only
HREDs (T-HRED) in the following. Our model is
most similar to the Multimodal HRED (M-HRED)
of Saha et al. (2017), with context and KB exten-

image representations (which act as input to the context encoder, see Figure 2), we employ late fusion of
the knowledge base vector at the decoder level. For simplicity, we show a context of 2 turns.
The whole model is trained using cross entropy on

3.1 Hierarchical Encoder
The encoder is formed of the following modules:
Utterance (Text) encoder: We pass each utter-
ance (previous system responses as well as current
user query) in a given context through a text en-
coder. We use bidirectional GRU (f text
) to gener-
(cf. Eq. (3)).

Image encoder: We ﬁrst extract the ‘local’ im-
age representations for all images in a dialogue
turn (denoted by genc
(imgk) in Eq. (4)) and con-
catenate them together.1 This concatenated vector
is passed through a linear layer to form the ‘global’
image context for a single turn, denoted by himg

Query encoder: Each chat session contains
multiple queries to the database which retrieve the
relevant product suited to user requirements at spe-
ciﬁc turn. We replicate this query for subsequent
dialogue turns until a new query is triggered by the
system. This query acts as knowledge base for the
model at each turn. We show a sample input to the
model in Figure 4. We used unidirectional GRU
cell to encode the query input hquery
Entity encoder: The input to the entity encoder
is a list of entities relevant to the query at hand
(see Figure 5). GRU cells are used to produce the
resulting hent

egorises products into synonym sets (synsets) and

provides a list of celebrities endorsing each synset
(see Section 4.1 for details).

This input is used speciﬁcally for the ‘celebrity’
intent in our model, where the user asks about
celebrities endorsing a product. For each target
prediction with celebrity intent, we ﬁrst extract
the relevant celebrity proﬁles using basic pattern
matching over the user utterance. For each of the
celebrities in the user query, we order the corre-
sponding synsets by their probability of endorse-
ment. If no celebrity is found, we use synset infor-
mation from the query to extract celebrities which
endorse the corresponding synset.

Input feeding decoder

3.3
We use an input feeding decoder with the atten-
tion mechanism of Luong et al. (2015). We con-
catenate the KB input hkb
n with the decoder input
(cf. Eq. (10), where hdec
N ). The rationale
behind this late fusion of KB representation is that
KB input remains the same for a given context and

n,0 = hcxt

does not change on each turn. On the other hand,
images and textual response together form a con-
text in a dialogue turn and thus we fuse them early
at the encoder level. The decoder is trained using
cross-entropy loss deﬁned in Eq. (2).

4 Experiments and Results
4.1 Dataset
Our work is based on the Multimodal Dialogue
(MMD) dataset (Saha et al., 2017), which con-
sists of 150k chat sessions.2 User queries can be
complex from the perspective of multimodal task-
speciﬁc dialogue, such as “Show me more images
of the 3rd product in some different directions”.
However, it also heavily relies on the external KB
to answer product attributes related to user queries,
such as “What is the brand/material of the suit in
3rd image?” or “Show something similar to 1st
result but in a different material”. This dataset
contains raw chat logs as well as metadata infor-
mation of the corresponding products. Around
400 anonymised celebrity proﬁles have been in-
troduced in the system to emulate endorsement in
recommendation, such as “What kind of slippers
are endorsed by cel 145?”. For each dialogue turn,
there are manual annotations of the user intent
available. We use the intents to construct celebrity
encodings. On average, each session contains 40
dialogue turns. The system response depends on
the intent state of the user query and on average
contains 8 words and 4 images per utterance. We
created our own version of the dataset from the
raw chat logs of the dialogue session and metadata
information. As discussed in Section 3.1, this was
necessary to model the visual context over multi-
ple images. We created the KB input to our model
as described in Section 3.2 from the raw chat logs
and the metadata information.

Implementation

We used PyTorch3 (Paszke et al., 2017) for our ex-
periments.4 We did not use any kind of delexi-
calisation5 and rely on our model to directly learn

vided by the dataset authors.

coders and decoders are based on 1-layer GRU
cells (Cho et al., 2014) with 512 as the hidden state
size. We used the 4096 dimensional FC6 layer im-
age representations from VGG-19 (Simonyan and
Zisserman, 2015) provided by Saha et al. (2017).
Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2015) was chosen as the
optimizer, and we clipped gradients greater than
5. We experimented with different learning rates
and settled on the value of 0.0004. Dropout of 0.3
is applied to all the RNN cells to avoid overﬁtting,
and we perform early stopping by tracking the val-
idation loss (with single trial for each experiment).

4.3 Analysis and Results
We evaluate our response generation using the
BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), METEOR (Lavie
and Agarwal, 2007) and ROUGE-L (Lin and Och,
2004) automatic metrics.6 We reproduce the base-
line results from Saha et al. (2017) using their code
and data-generation scripts.7

grounding in KB gave a stark uplift (M-HRED–
attn–kb vs. M-HRED–attn) for a given context
size. Adding KB input boosts performance more
for a shorter context compared to longer context. It
can be conjectured that the longer context contains
some of the information that is in the KB queries
and so there is less impact of the KB input when
we include the longer context. Compare the dif-
ference for M-HRED–attn–kb vs. M-HRED–attn
for a context of 2 (3 BLEU points) vs. 5 (2 BLEU
points) in Table 1. Conversely, longer context im-
proves more the models without KB queries.

In summary, our best performing model (M-
HRED–attn–kb) outperforms the model of Saha
et al. (2017) by 9 BLEU points. We also anal-
ysed our generated outputs for different user in-
tents, as shown in Table 2. As assumed, intents
such as ‘show-similar-to’ and ‘sort-results’ are rel-
atively easy from the perspective of NLG, requir-
ing no information about the product description;
our model matches the reference almost perfectly.
We found great improvements for the ‘ask-
attribute’ intent where the KB-grounded model
could answer correctly questions related to brand
or colour and other attributes of the product, which
resulted in an increase of 10 BLEU points on test
instances with this user intent (M-HRED–attn–kb
compared to M-HRED–attn). Similarly, in the ex-
ample related to the ‘buy’ intent in Table 3, our
model is able to learn that the product bought by
the user is ‘kurta’, which probably cannot be cap-
tured by the visual features. Hence, M-HRED–
attn produces ‘jeans’ on the output. M-HRED–
attn–kb on the other hand learns this information
from the KB. We also found that our BLEU score
for the ‘show-orientation’ intent has decreased
w.r.t. to the non-KB-grounded model. A detailed

5 Conclusion and Future Work
This work focuses on the task of textual response
generation in multimodal task-oriented dialogue
system. We used the recently released Multimodal
Dialogue (MMD) dataset (Saha et al., 2017) for
experiments and introduced a novel conversational
model grounded in language, vision and Knowl-
edge Base (KB). Our best performing model out-
performs the baseline model (Saha et al., 2017) by
9 BLEU points, improving context modelling in
multimodal dialogue generation. Even though our

model outputs showed a substantial improvement
(over 3 BLEU points) on incorporating KB in-
formation, integrating visual context still remains
a bottleneck, as also observed by Agrawal et al.
(2016); Qian et al. (2018). This suggests the need
for a better mechanism to encode visual context.

Since our KB-grounded model assumes user in-
tent annotation and KB queries as additional in-
puts, we plan to build a model to provide them
automatically.
