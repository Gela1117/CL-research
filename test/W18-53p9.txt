Abstract

BIOASQ Task B Phase B challenge focuses on
extracting answers from snippets for a given
question. The dataset provided by the orga-
nizers contains answers, but not all their vari-
ants. Henceforth a manual annotation was per-
formed to extract all forms of correct answers.
This article shows the impact of using all oc-
currences of correct answers for training on the
evaluation scores which are improved signiﬁ-
cantly.

Introduction

BIOASQ1 challenge is a large-scale biomedical
semantic indexing and question answering task
(Tsatsaronis et al., 2015) which has been success-
ful for 5 years. The challenge proposes several
tasks using Biomedical data. One of the tasks fo-
cuses on Biomedical question answering (Task B
Phase B - we further refer it as B) where the goal
is to extract answers for a given question from rel-
evant snippets.

Several teams have participated actively, and a
noticeable aspect is that the results of the task B
are much lower compared to open domain QA
evaluations, as in SQUAD2. Some reasons can be
the low dataset size and the format of the answers
provided by the organizers. Bioasq provides only
certain answer forms in the gold standard data and
not all the variants of the answers in the given snip-
pets.

In this paper, we study the inﬂuence of en-
riching the training data by manually annotated
variants of gold standard answers on the evalua-
tion performance. We show the impact of the en-
riched data by experimenting on 5B and 6B train-
ing datasets. Our method outperforms the best-

performing systems from Bioasq 5B by 7.3% on
strict accuracy and 18% on lenient accuracy.

2 Related Work

Several works in the past BIOASQ tasks have
used classical question answering pipeline archi-
tecture adapted to the biomedical domain. Some
use the domain-speciﬁc information from UMLS
tools such as Metamap (Schulze et al., 2016),
along with other NLP tools like Corenlp, LingPipe
(Yang et al., 2016). A typical question answering
pipeline consists of:

1. Question processing for question type detec-

tion and lexical answer type detection.

2. Document retrieval (Task B Phase A)

3. Answer extraction by answer re-ranking on
the candidate answers generated in the pre-
vious phases, done in a supervised learning
manner.

In the open domain, deep learning models are
extensively used in machine reading task. Datasets
such as MS Marco by (Nguyen et al., 2016),
SQUAD by (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) and Wikiread-
ing by (Hewlett et al., 2016) have made it eas-
ier for deep learning models to perform better on
machine reading task. One of the ﬁrst attempts
to use deep learning algorithms for the Bioasq
task was reported in BIOASQ 5 by (Wiese et al.,
2017b) where the dataset was adapted to be used
as a machine reading dataset whose goal is to ex-
tract answers from snippets. The authors use a
model trained on open domain questions, and per-
form domain adaptation to biomedical domain us-
ing BIOASQ data. Their system got one of the
best results whose methods are reported in the sec-
tion 5.

Bioasq 6 is the sixth challenge and the evalua-
tion measures for Bioasq task B has always been
the same. Strict Accuracy, Lenient Accuracy and
Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) are the 3 evaluation
measures used. To compute the scores, the exact
match of strings between the predictions and the
gold standard answers is used to decide if a system
answer is correct. Strict accuracy is the rate of top
1 exact answers. Lenient accuracy is the rate of ex-
act answers in top 5 predictions. MRR is the mean
reciprocal rank computed on the top 5 system an-
swers. These measures have been the same since
the 1st challenge, although the ﬁrst four challenges
had triples and concepts along with snippets in the
data. In the last two challenges, only relevant snip-
pets for questions are released.

Similar evaluations are performed in machine
reading tasks like in SQUAD where top 1 accu-
racy and F1 scores are computed by comparing
exact matching strings. One main assumption in
machine reading task is that the answer strings are
substrings of the snippets, which implies that an-
swers have to be extracted from the snippets.

In Bioasq, the answers are curated by human ex-
perts by analyzing the triples, concepts, and snip-
pets (or paragraphs). Thus, the Bioasq dataset and
evaluation measures are very similar to that of ma-
chine reading task, but the major difference apart
from the dataset size are the answers instances
provided as gold standard which does not contain
all the occurrences, abbreviations, different forms
of answers which are present in the snippets.

In (Wiese et al., 2017b), the authors transform
Bioasq Phase B as a machine reading task with
domain adaptation. Gold standard answer strings
and their offsets are automatically searched in the
snippets for exact match and treated as answers if
only they are found in the snippets, i.e., the answer
string must be a substring of the snippet. By doing
so the dataset size is reduced to 65% of Bioasq 5
train set which was suitable for adaptation. Other
35% of the questions did not have matching an-
swers in the snippets, because of different variants
of answers in the snippets, missing abbreviations,
or irrelevant snippets.

This snippet annotation method can result in:
• False positive: an answer mentioned in the
snippet which does not answer the question.

• False negative: a snippet answers the ques-
tion but does not have the exact string com-
pared to the gold standard string.

We found that in Bioasq 6B training dataset for
factoid questions, 205 out of 619 questions have
false negative answers (33% of the dataset) which
may result in some problems:
• Less data for learning;
• The model does not learn to extract all the

variants;

• Evaluation is done using such gold standard
data which will lower the results even though
the model is performing well.

Below are some examples for which the an-
swers returned from a reference system is correct
(when evaluated manually) but the automatic eval-
uation classiﬁes it as incorrect.

Q: Which calcium channels does ethosuximide
target?
P: ..neuropathic pain is blocked by ethosuximide,
known to block T-type calcium channels,..

Prediction: T-type calcium
Gold standard: T-type calcium channels

Example 1: Missing keywords

Q: Which disease can be treated with Dela-
manid?
P: In conclusion, delamanid is a useful addition
to the treatment options currently available for
patients with MDR-TB.

Prediction: MDR-TB
Gold standard: tuberculosis

Example 2: Abbreviations

In example 1, because of a missing word ”chan-
nels”, the predicted answer is marked incorrect.
In example 2, MDR-TB stands for Multi-drug-
resistant tuberculosis, which is from a relevant
snippet but since the gold standard has only tuber-
culosis, it is marked incorrect. Contextually both
are valid answers.

To overcome this problem and enrich the an-
swer space correctly, we manually annotated
618 factoid question-answers pairs from training
dataset of 6B task, by annotating the substring
of the gold standard answers in the snippets, and
adding answers with abbreviations, multi-word
answers, synonyms,
that are likely correct an-
swers. We explain this in detail in the following
section.

73Figure 1: Brat annotation tool

4 Annotations

This section presents the details of the annotations
performed manually on the BIOASQ 6B training
dataset and presents some statistics.

Our annotations include the following type of

answers:

• Exact Answer - Exact match with gold stan-
dard (GS) answers, which can also be anno-
tated automatically, and different variants of
the answers. For example, the annotation of
a single GS answer ”Transcription factor EB
(TFEB)” resulted in 3 annotations, ”Tran-
scription factor EB”, ”TFEB”, ”Transcrip-
tion factor EB (TFEB)”.

• Lenient Answer - a more general form or a
more speciﬁc form of an answer. An exam-
ple is ”Telomerase” for ”Human telomerase
reverse transcriptase”.

• Paragraph Answer - The answer matches
with gold standard but the snippet alone is not
relevant to the question.

We came across several kinds of snippets. A
supporting snippet, or answering snippet, is a snip-
pet that contains the answer and enough elements
for justifying it. It is a correct answer to the ques-
tion (snippet starting at line 5 in Figure 1 for ex-
ample). A snippet that contains the answer with-
out justiﬁcation towards the question will not be
annotated with the answer as correct and is con-
sidered as a non-supporting snippet (snippet start-
ing at line 3 in Figure 1). A snippet that does not
contain the answer cannot be a supporting snippet,

henceforth it is an irrelevant snippet (snippet start-
ing at line 8 in Figure 1).

We use Brat3 annotation tool by (Stenetorp
et al., 2012) shown in Fig. 1 to perform the man-
ual annotations of the snippets with the answer to
the question. The annotations done include the an-
swer string along with their character offsets in
the snippet. Answers were annotated by 3 peo-
ple from computer science background and mul-
tiple discussions were held to discuss problematic
answers which involved looking upon the internet
for some medical term meanings.

Annotations were initially done on the Bioasq
5B training set and the additional questions from
5B test sets whose answers are present in the 6B
training set were annotated later on 6B data. So
the changes done (if any) on 6B training set for
previous year questions from 5B set are not con-
sidered.

The annotation ﬁles are freely available4 and
can be used by researchers who can get the Bioasq
dataset.

Some statistics of the dataset are listed in Ta-
ble 1 for the automatically annotated answers from
gold standard data and the fully annotated data
with manual annotations. The annotations are
done on 618 BIOASQ 6B training dataset ques-
tions. Out of 619 factoid questions, 1 question
does not have any snippets.

Only 426 questions contain answers from auto-

matic annotation.

”Answers” are the count of answers present in
the snippets. Avg score represents an average over
the total number of questions (i.e. 618). Since in

gold standard data, only 426 questions have gold
answers in snippets, it is normal for the average to
fall below 1. It is clear from the table that the full
annotated data contain at least 3 times (1814 an-
swers) more the number of candidate answers over
the provided gold standard ones (500 answers).

We found that some answers contained the
whole snippet as an answer and that 3503 snip-
pets are repeated in the 6B train set. After ﬁl-
tering those repeated snippets we found 3286 dif-
ferent snippets containing exact matching answers
extracted automatically from gold standard data
and 4965 unique snippets manually annotated with
correct answers.

5 Experiments

The goal of our experiments is to study the impact
of the data augmentation on training and evaluat-
ing a system.

Henceforth, we follow the process of (Wiese
et al., 2017b) and use a machine reading model de-
veloped by (Chen et al., 2017) that is pre-trained
on SQUAD dataset (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) for
open domain questions and ﬁne tuned to biomedi-
cal questions.

To study the impact on the training process and
the evaluations, we train the models using sep-
arately the automatically annotated data and the
fully manually annotated data. We also evaluate
them using both kinds of data separately.

5.1 QA system overview
We present here the adaptation of an existing
model named DRQA reader by (Chen et al., 2017)
to the biomedical domain as presented in (Kamath
et al., 2018).

DRQA reader has three components:

1. Input layer: where the input question words
and input passage words are encoded using a
pretrained word embedding space.

2. Neural layer: RNN or LSTM networks.

3. Output layer or decoding layer: where the

outputs are start and end tokens representing
a span of an extracted answer.

The reader model takes as input, the question sen-
tence and the answering snippet and predicts the
substring of the snippet that is the answer.

In the input layer, word embeddings are used to
encode the words of snippets and questions into
vectors, along with textual features such as Part
of Speech tags, Named-Entity tokens, Term fre-
quencies of the words in the snippet. The authors
use aligned question embeddings where an atten-
tion score captures the similarity between snip-
pet words and questions words. The neural layer,
where the core DNN model is deﬁned, uses dif-
ferent NN architectures to capture semantic simi-
larities between the question/snippet pairs. It use
LSTMs to encode the snippets and an RNN to en-
code the questions. In the output layer, two inde-
pendent classiﬁers use a bilinear term to capture
the similarity between snippet words and question
words and compute the probabilities of each token
being start and end of the answer span. We take all
possible scores of start and end token predictions
and restrict the span between start and end tokens
to 15 tokens. We perform an outer product be-
tween these scores and consider top 5 spans using
an argmax value to get these ﬁnal predictions.

biomedical domain

Domain adaptation (also referred to as ﬁne tuning)
is performed on the BIOASQ dataset as shown
in Figure 2 where the model is pre-trained with
SQUAD dataset and ﬁne-tuned with BIOASQ be-
fore predicting on test sets. Pre-training is train-
ing a model from scratch with randomly initial-
ized weights. Fine-tuning is training on a model
with previously trained weights rather than ran-
domly initialized ones. The advantage of pre-

Table 2: K-fold evaluation on different train sets with Gold and Anno data. DeepQA scores are presented by
(Wiese et al., 2017a)

training with SQUAD dataset is that the DNN
model will learn and perform better while trained
on a larger training dataset. Since the target dataset
is in the biomedical domain, ﬁnetuning the previ-
ously learned model will have a positive impact on
the test set predictions, as shown in (Wiese et al.,
2017a).

Several embedding spaces were tested as input
vectors (Kamath et al., 2017) and the best per-
forming ones which were the Glove embeddings
trained on common crawl data with 840B tokens,
were chosen as input to the system. Unknown
words were initialized as zero vectors.

As BIOASQ questions have several answer-
ing snippets, we treat each question and a snip-
pet as a training sample which might often result
in repeated questions with different snippets, i.e.
for each training example, there is a question, a
unique snippet and the start and end token string
offsets of the answer in the snippet. Our model
predicts one scored answer per snippet, and the ﬁ-
nal result is made of the ordered list of answers
for the same question. We consider only the top 5
answers.

5.2 Datasets
We perform ﬁne-tuning on two datasets namely

• BIOASQ 5B training set, which contains the
4B training data + the answers of the 4B test
data - We term it as 5B.

• BIOASQ 6B training set, which contains the
5B training data + the answers of the 5B test
set - We term it as 6B.

We term the automatically annotated training data
as Gold, and manually annotated training data as
Anno.

The pre-trained model on open domain QA data
is ﬁne-tuned on the above listed Bioasq datasets
separately. Evaluation is performed by K-fold

cross validation because of the small scale of the
data (Table 2), and on the ofﬁcial test sets of
Bioasq 5B (Table 3), which were separated from
the training data while ﬁne-tuning.

The explanation of scores reported in table 2
and 3 along with the corresponding experiments
on the datasets listed above, is as follows. On
the data of Trainset mentioned in the ﬁrst row, we
ﬁne-tune it with Finetune data on the second row -
which is Gold or Anno. version of the answers.

The ofﬁcial evaluation measures5 using Gold or
Anno. version of the answers are highlighted in the
third row. The strict and lenient accuracies along
with the MRR are reported.

Gold version of 5B data contains 313 questions
and Gold version of 6B data contains 428 ques-
tions. We consider the remaining questions with
no matching answers as incorrectly answered,
hence evaluating over all the questions of the
datasets (5B - 486 questions, 6B - 618 questions).
Annotated 5B data contains 483 questions and 6B
data contains 618 questions.

Overall results of 5B test sets presented in Table
3 are evaluated on 150 questions from the test sets
of 5B challenge whose gold standard answers are
present in 6B challenge train set.

To compare our scores with the ones reported
in (Wiese et al., 2017a) and also since the size of
the dataset is small, we perform K-Fold (5) eval-
uations which are reported in Table 2. To com-
pare with previously reported ofﬁcial test scores
in Bioasq 5, we train on 5B training set and test on
5B test sets which are reported in Table 3.

6 Results

performance as well as the evaluations with Gold

and Anno. versions of answers.

In Table 2, training on Gold and evaluating on
Gold are the baseline scores. DeepQA MRR score
is the K-fold evaluation score of MRR reported on
5B train set by (Wiese et al., 2017a).

Comparing the DeepQA MRR score with
theGold and Anno. 5B versions, there is an im-
provement of at least 17% (Anno.
training and
Anno. evaluation) to 8% (Gold training and Anno.
evaluation).

In terms of accuracy,

training the model on
Anno. version and evaluating on Anno. version
of answers fetch best results by 3.68% and 8.58%
on Strict accuracy, 14% and 14.73% on Lenient
accuracy in 5B and 6B respectively.

Training on Anno. and evaluating on Gold has
low scores in almost all experiments because of
the model which learns on different forms of an-
swers, therefore predicts different forms of an-
swers which are not present in the Gold version.

In Table 3, because of a low number of ques-
tions in the ofﬁcial test sets ranging from 25 to
35 questions, the scores are computed over all 5B
batch test sets by using individual batch results for
the number of correct answers from ofﬁcial Bioasq
scores and calculating the score over a total num-
ber of questions in the 5 batches (5B test sets - 150
questions). The scores by (Wiese et al., 2017b)
and Lab Zhu, Fudan Univer are the best ofﬁcial
results in Bioasq 5. We calculated strict and le-

nient accuracy as mentioned above and our scores
are better than both best ofﬁcial results by 6.67%
for strict accuracy and 13.34% lenient accuracy on
Gold version training, 7.33% for strict accuracy
and 18% lenient accuracy on Anno. version train-
ing.

In Table 4, MRR scores are reported separately
for each batch. MRR scores in general have the
best scores compared to both (Wiese et al., 2017b)
and Lab Zhu, Fudan Univer by training on Anno.
and evaluating on Anno. versions.
7 Conclusion and Future Work
We present the importance of using all variants of
answers in the snippets for adapting the Bioasq
dataset to machine reading task format. We show
that the results can be much higher than the ofﬁ-
cially reported ones if all the variants of the an-
swers are annotated correctly in the training sets.
We perform manual annotations to show this im-
pact. Future work would focus on automatic de-
tection of these variants of answers in the snippets.
