Abstract

This paper presents a statistical model to
predict Japanese word order in the dou-
ble object constructions. We employed a
Bayesian linear mixed model with man-
ually annotated predicate-argument struc-
ture data. The ﬁndings from the reﬁned
corpus analysis conﬁrmed the effects of
information status of an NP as ‘given-
new ordering’ in addition to the effects of
‘long-before-short’ as a tendency of the
general Japanese word order.

Introduction

1
Because Japanese exhibits a ﬂexible word order,
potential factors that predict word orders of a
given construction in Japanese have been recently
delved into, particularly in the ﬁeld of compu-
tational linguistics (Yamashita and Kondo, 2011;
Orita, 2017). One of the major ﬁndings relevant to
the current study is ‘long-before-short’, whereby
a long noun phrase (NP) tends to be scrambled
ahead of a short NP (Yamashita and Chang, 2001).
This paper sheds light on those factors in dou-
ble object constructions (DOC), where either (1)
an indirect object (IOBJ) or (2) a direct object
(DOBJ) can precede the other object:

Since both of the word orders are available,
studies in theoretical syntax have been disputing
about what is the canonical word order under the
hypothesis of deriving one word order (i.e., either

IOBJ-DOBJ or DOBJ-IOBJ) from another in the
context of derivational syntax (Hoji, 1985; Miya-
gawa, 1997; Matsuoka, 2003). In this paper, we do
not attempt to adjudicate upon the dispute solely
based on the frequency of the two word orders in
a corpus, but aim to detect principal factors that
predict the word order in the DOC, which may
eventually lead to resolving the issue in theoreti-
cal syntax. To that end, we employed a Bayesian
linear mixed model with potential factors affecting
the word orders as a preliminary study.

Other than the factor ‘long-before-short’ pro-
posed in previous studies, the key factor in the
current study is an information status of an NP
in a given context under the theoretical frame-
work of information structure (Lambrecht, 1994;
Vallduv´ı and Engdahl, 1996). The framework
provides us key categories, such as (information-
ally) given/old, new, topic, and focus, to classify
an NP as how it functions in a particular con-
text. We assume the information status as one
of the principle predictors based on the following
two reasons; (i) a discourse-given element tends
to precede a discourse-new one in a sentence in
Japanese (Kuno, 1978, 2004; Nakagawa, 2016),
(ii) focused or new elements in Japanese tend to
appear in a position immediately preceding the
predicate (Kuno, 1978; Kim, 1988; Ishihara, 2001;
Vermeulen, 2012). These two claims regarding the
general word order of Japanese are combined into
the following hypothesis regarding the word or-
ders in the DOC.

(3) Our hypothesis:

In the DOC, a discourse-given object
tends to appear on the left of the other ob-
ject, and a discourse-new object tends to
be on the right side.

Incorporating the information status of an NP
with another factor ‘long-before-short’ proposed
in the previous studies, we built a statistical model

to predict the word orders in the DOC. One im-
portant advantage of our study is that, with the lat-
est version of the corpus we used (See Section 3),
the information status of an NP can be analyzed
not simply by bipartite groups as either pronoun
(given) or others (new) but by the number of co-
indexed items in a preceding text.

2 Preceding Work

Table 1 shows a comparison with the latest corpus
studies on Japanese word ordering.

Sasano and Okumura (2016) explored the
canonical word order of Japanese double object
constructions (either SUBJ-IOBJ-DOBJ-PRED or
SUBJ-DOBJ-IOBJ-PRED) by a large-scale web
corpus. The web corpus contains 10 billion sen-
tences parsed by the Japanese morphological an-
alyzer JUMAN and the syntactic analyzer KNP.
In their analysis, the parse trees without syntac-
tic ambiguity were extracted from the web corpus,
and the word order was estimated by verb types
with a linear regression and normalized pointwise
mutual information. Their model did not include
any inter-sentential factors such as coreference.

Orita (2017) made a statistical model to predict
a scrambled word order as (direct) object-subject.
She used the NAIST Text corpus which has a man-
ual annotation of predicate-argument structure and
coreference information. She explored the effect
of syntactic priming, NP length, animacy, and
given-new bipartite information status (given was
deﬁned as having a lexically identical item in a
previous text). Her frequentism statistical analysis
(simple logistic regression) did not detect a signif-
icant effect of the given-new factor on the order of
a subject and an object.

As a preliminary study which features coref-
erential
information as a potential factor, we
used manual annotation of syntactic dependencies,
predicate-argument structures and coreference in-

formation, employing a Bayesian statistical analy-
sis on the small-sized well-maintained data.

3 Experiments

3.1 Corpora: BCCWJ-PAS
We used the ‘Balanced Corpus of Contempo-
rary Written Japanese’ (BCCWJ) (Maekawa et al.,
2014), which includes morphological
informa-
tion and sentence boundaries, as the target cor-
pus. The corpus was extended with annotations
of predicate-argument structures as BCCWJ-PAS
(BCCWJ Predicate Argument Structures), based
on the NAIST Text Corpus (Iida et al., 2007) com-
patible standard. We revised all annotations of the
BCCWJ-PAS data, including subjects (with case
marker -ga), direct objects (with case marker -o),
and indirect objects (with case marker -ni), as well
as coreferential information of NPs. After the revi-
sion process, syntactic dependencies of BCCWJ-
DepPara (Asahara and Matsumoto, 2016) were
overlaid on the predicate-argument structures.

We extracted 4-tuples of subject (subj), direct
object (dobj),
indirect object (iobj) and predi-
cate (pred) from the overlaid data. Excluding
4-tuples with zero-pronoun, case alternation, or
inter-clause dependencies from the target data, we
obtained 584 samples of the 4-tuples.

Figure 1 shows an example sentence from BC-
CWJ Yahoo! Answer sample (OC09 04653). The
surface is segmented into base phrases, which is
the unit to evaluate the distance between two con-
stituents as in the following pairs of the 4-tuples:
subj-pred (distsubj
pred), iobj-pred
(distiobj
iobj ), subj-dobj (distsubj
dobj ),
and iobj-dobj (distiobj
dobj). The distance was calcu-
lated from the rightmost word in each pair. For
example, in Figure 1, distsubj
pred is identiﬁed as the
distance between “” and “” as 4.

on a mora count (in pronunciation) available in
BCCWJ as N subj

is 6. Note that an NP may contain more than one
base phrase including an embedded clause. We
evaluated the maximum span of the dependency
subtree in BCCWJ-DepPara as a length of the NP.
In addition, the numbers of coreferent items in
a preceding text were modeled as ﬁxed effects.
The numbers of coreferent items for subject, di-
rect object and indirect object were obtained from
coref , N dobj
the BCCWJ-PAS annotations as N subj

and N iobj

sic statistics of the distance, mora, and number of
coreferent items.

3.2 Statistical Analysis
We used Bayesian linear mixed models (Sorensen
et al., 2016) (BLMM) for the statistical analysis on
the distance between arguments as well as an argu-
ment and its predicate. We modeled the following
formula:
distlef t

right ∼ Normal(µ, σ)

µ ← α + βsubj

mora · N subj

mora + βsubj

coref · N subj

mora · N dobj

tance between left and right elements, which is

mora, N dobj

mora, and N iobj

modeled by a normal distribution with average µ
and stdev σ. µ is deﬁned by a linear formula with
an intercept α and two types of interest coefﬁ-
cients. N subj
mora are the number
of morae of a subject, a direct object, and an indi-
rect object, respectively. The subject and objects
can be composed of more than one phrase, and
when they contain a clause, the number of morae
was deﬁned with the clause length.

N subj

coref , N dobj

coref , and N iobj

coref stand for the num-
ber of preceding coreferent NPs of a subject, a di-
rect object, and an indirect, respectively. βa
b are
the slope parameters for the coefﬁcients N a
b . Note
that the distance was measured by the number of
base phrase units, and a minus value indicates a
distance in an opposite direction.
We ran 4 chains × 2000 post-warmup iteration,

and all models were converged.

4 Results and Discussions
4.1 Results
Table 3 shows the estimated parameters by the
BLMM; the values are means with standard devi-
ations (in brackets). The ﬁndings are summarized
as follows.

First, the distance between a subject and its
predicate (distsubj
pred) is affected only by the num-
ber of morae of a subject, which indicates that a
longer subject NP has a longer distance from its
predicate.

Second, the distance between a direct object and
its predicate (distdobj
pred) is affected by the number of
morae of the direct object, the number of its pre-
ceding coreferent items, and the number of morae
of the indirect object. It indicates that i) a longer
direct object has a longer distance from its predi-
cate, ii) a direct object with more coreferent items
in a preceding text has a longer distance from its
predicate, and iii) a longer indirect object makes
shorter the distance between the direct object and
its predicate.

Third, the distance between an indirect object
and its predicate (distiobj
pred) is affected by the num-
ber of morae of the indirect object, the number
of its preceding coreferent items, the number of
morae of a direct object, and the number of pre-
ceding coreferent items of a subject. It indicates
that i) a longer indirect object has a longer distance
from its predicate, ii) an indirect object with more
coreferent items in a preceding text has a longer
distance from its predicate, iii) a longer direct ob-

more coreferent items makes shorter the distance
between the indirect object and its predicate.

The distance between arguments
dobj , and distiobj

(distsubj
iobj ,
distsubj
dobj) represents nearly the same
tendency as the combination of the predicate-
argument distance. However, the number of morae
of an argument is correlated with the length of the
argument (i.e., the number of base phrases), and
thus, the distance between the leftmost and right-
most arguments (e.g. subject, direct object) is af-
fected by the number of morae of the middle argu-
ment (e.g. N iobj

mora).

It is also conﬁrmed by the minus values as the esti-
mated coefﬁcients for the number of morae of one
object in relation to the order of the other object

and its predicate (N dobj

to precede the other object in the DOC.

The results revealed that the subject tends to pre-

object constructions. Although the indirect object
tends to precede the direct object, it is not signiﬁ-

This article presents a Bayesian statistical analy-
sis on Japanese word ordering in the double ob-
ject constructions. It revealed the ‘given-new or-

conﬁrmed the ‘long-before-short’ tendency for all
of the arguments in the constructions.

Setting off from the current preliminary study,
our future work is to investigate effects of verb
type and animacy of an NP. We are currently an-
notating the labels of a Japanese thesaurus ‘Word
List by Semantic Principles’ (WLSP) (Kokurit-
sukokugokenkyusho, 1964), which enables us to
explore those effects.
